"Parker, DC; Manson, SM; Janssen, MA; Hoffmann, MJ; Deadman, P",Multi-agent systems for the simulation of land-use and land-cover change: A review,ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS,"This article presents an overview of multi-agent system models of land-use/cover change (MAS/LUCC models). This special class of LUCC models combines a cellular landscape model with agent-based representations of decision making, integrating the two components through specification of interdependencies and feedbacks between agents and their environment. The authors review alternative LUCC modeling techniques and discuss the ways in which MAS/LUCC models may overcome some important limitations of existing techniques. We briefly review ongoing MAS/LUCC modeling efforts in four research areas. We discuss the potential strengths of MAS/LUCC models and suggest that these strengths guide researchers in assessing the appropriate choice of model for their particular research question. We find that MAS/LUCC models are particularly well suited for representing complex spatial interactions under heterogeneous conditions and for modeling decentralized, autonomous decision making. We discuss a range of possible roles for MAS/LUCC models, from abstract models designed to derive stylized hypotheses to empirically detailed simulation models appropriate for scenario and policy analysis. We also discuss the challenge of validation and verification for MAS/LUCC models. Finally, we outline important challenges and open research questions in this new field. We conclude that, while significant challenges exist, these models offer a promising new tool for researchers whose goal is to create fine-scale models of LUCC phenomena that focus on human-environment interactions.",JUN,2003,93,2,10.1111/1467-8306.9302004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-8306.9302004

The authors reviewed the extent to which these neighborhood factors have been addressed in population-level cancer research by scanning the literature for research focused on specific social and/or built environment characteristics and their association with outcomes across the cancer continuum, including incidence, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and survival. The commonalities and differences in methodologies across studies, the current challenges in research methodology, and future directions in this research also were addressed. The assessment of social and built environment factors in relation to cancer is a relatively new field, with 82% of the 34 reviewed articles published since 2010. Across the wide range of social and built environment exposures and cancer outcomes considered by the studies, numerous associations were reported. However, the directions and magnitudes of associations varied, in large part because of the variation in cancer sites and outcomes studied, but also likely because of differences in study populations, geographic regions, and, importantly, choice of neighborhood measures and geographic scales. The authors recommend that future studies consider the life-course implications of cancer incidence and survival, integrate secondary and self-report data, consider work neighborhood environments, and further develop analytical and statistical approaches appropriate to the geospatial and multilevel nature of the data. Incorporating social and built environment factors into research on cancer etiology and outcomes can provide insights into disease processes, identify vulnerable populations, and generate results with translational impact of relevance for interventionists and policy makers.

Here we explore new methods by which BN model development and application are being joined with other tools and model frameworks. Advances include improving areas of Bayesian classifiers and machine-learning algorithms for model structuring and parameterization, and development of time-dynamic models. Increasingly, BN models are being integrated with: management decision networks; structural equation modeling of causal networks; Bayesian neural networks; combined discrete and continuous variables; object-oriented and agent-based models; state-and-transition models; geographic information systems; quantum probability; and other fields. Integrated BNs (IBNs) are becoming useful tools in risk analysis, risk management, and decision science for resource planning and environmental management. In the near future, IBNs may become self-structuring, self-learning systems fed by real-time monitoring data.

"Perez, Liliana; Dragicevic, Suzana",An agent-based approach for modeling dynamics of contagious disease spread,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS,"Background: The propagation of communicable diseases through a population is an inherent spatial and temporal process of great importance for modern society. For this reason a spatially explicit epidemiologic model of infectious disease is proposed for a greater understanding of the disease's spatial diffusion through a network of human contacts. Objective: The objective of this study is to develop an agent-based modelling approach the integrates geographic information systems (GIS) to simulate the spread of a communicable disease in an urban environment, as a result of individuals' interactions in a geospatial context. Methods: The methodology for simulating spatiotemporal dynamics of communicable disease propagation is presented and the model is implemented using measles outbreak in an urban environment as a case study. Individuals in a closed population are explicitly represented by agents associated to places where they interact with other agents. They are endowed with mobility, through a transportation network allowing them to move between places within the urban environment, in order to represent the spatial heterogeneity and the complexity involved in infectious diseases diffusion. The model is implemented on georeferenced land use dataset from Metro Vancouver and makes use of census data sets from Statistics Canada for the municipality of Burnaby, BC, Canada study site. Results: The results provide insights into the application of the model to calculate ratios of susceptible/infected in specific time frames and urban environments, due to its ability to depict the disease progression based on individuals' interactions. It is demonstrated that the dynamic spatial interactions within the population lead to high numbers of exposed individuals who perform stationary activities in areas after they have finished commuting. As a result, the sick individuals are concentrated in geographical locations like schools and universities. Conclusion: The GIS-agent based model designed for this study can be easily customized to study the disease spread dynamics of any other communicable disease by simply adjusting the modeled disease timeline and/or the infection model and modifying the transmission process. This type of simulations can help to improve comprehension of disease spread dynamics and to take better steps towards the prevention and control of an epidemic outbreak.",5-Aug,2009,8,,10.1186/1476-072X-8-50,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1476-072X-8-50
"Warner, Koko; Afifi, Tamer",Where the rain falls: Evidence from 8 countries on how vulnerable households use migration to manage the risk of rainfall variability and food insecurity,CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT,"Up to present, research relating environmental change to human mobility has found out that environmental factors can play a role in migration without being conclusive. Further, in the context of climate change, scholarly literature on migration ranges across a host of climatic stressors and geographies, making it difficult to date to solve the debate whether migration is a form of adaptation or an indicator of limits to adaptation. To address both of these debates, original research was undertaken to answer the question 'under what circumstances do households (HHs) use migration as a risk management strategy when facing rainfall variability and food insecurity?'. This research administered a HH survey (n = 1300) and participatory research (n = 2000 respondents) in districts in eight countries (Guatemala, Peru, Ghana, Tanzania, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, and Vietnam). The findings reveal that the answer to how climatic stressors affect migration decisions and the degree to which migration improves the adaptive capacity of those HHs lie in the vulnerability of the HH and its sensitivity to climatic factors. The data reveal for the first time in a comparable global study distinct HH profiles of 'resilience' and 'vulnerability'. At the same time, the article distinguishes between 'content' migration - rather associated with resilient HHs - and 'erosive' migration - rather associated with vulnerable HHs. However, the article also highlights that there are not always clear cuts but very often grey areas and overlaps among the HHs of the study when applying these typologies. Moreover, the article relates these profiles to an agent-based modelling approach applied in the Tanzania case to explore under what scenarios rainfall variability and food security have the potential to become significant drivers of human mobility in particular regions of the world in the next two to three decades.",2-Jan,2014,6,1,10.1080/17565529.2013.835707,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2013.835707
"Schwarz, Nina; Ernst, Andreas",Agent-based modeling of the diffusion of environmental innovations - An empirical approach,TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE,"This paper presents an agent-based model of the diffusion of water-saving innovations. The empirical foundation of this model is a study, which was carried out for that specific purpose. As an example case, the diffusion of three water-related innovations in Southern Germany was chosen. The model represents a real geographic area and simulates the diffusion of showerheads, toilet flushes, and rain-harvesting systems. Agents are households of certain lifestyles, as represented by the Sinus-Milieus (R) from commercial Marketing. Agents use two different kinds of decision rules to decide upon adoption or rejection of the modeled innovations: A cognitively demanding deliberate decision rule and a very simple decision heuristic. Thus, the model integrates concepts of bounded rationality. The overall framework for decision-making is the Theory of Planned Behavior, which has been elaborated using innovation characteristics from diffusion research. The model was calibrated with empirical data stemming from a questionnaire survey and validated against independent data. Scenarios for the nearer future show that water-saving innovations will diffuse even without further promotion, and different promotion strategies that relate specifically to both innovations and lifestyles can be pointed out.

Methodologies adapt to the scale of interest and range from very detailed agent-based models to spatially-structured metapopulation models. One major issue thus concerns to what extent the geotemporal spreading pattern found by different modeling approaches may differ and depend on the different approximations and assumptions used. Methods: We provide for the first time a side-by-side comparison of the results obtained with a stochastic agent-based model and a structured metapopulation stochastic model for the progression of a baseline pandemic event in Italy, a large and geographically heterogeneous European country. The agent-based model is based on the explicit representation of the Italian population through highly detailed data on the socio-demographic structure. The metapopulation simulations use the GLobal Epidemic and Mobility (GLEaM) model, based on high-resolution census data worldwide, and integrating airline travel flow data with short-range human mobility patterns at the global scale. The model also considers age structure data for Italy. GLEaM and the agent-based models are synchronized in their initial conditions by using the same disease parameterization, and by defining the same importation of infected cases from international travels. Results: The results obtained show that both models provide epidemic patterns that are in very good agreement at the granularity levels accessible by both approaches, with differences in peak timing on the order of a few days. The relative difference of the epidemic size depends on the basic reproductive ratio, R-0, and on the fact that the metapopulation model consistently yields a larger incidence than the agent-based model, as expected due to the differences in the structure in the intra-population contact pattern of the approaches. The age breakdown analysis shows that similar attack rates are obtained for the younger age classes. Conclusions: The good agreement between the two modeling approaches is very important for defining the tradeoff between data availability and the information provided by the models. The results we present define the possibility of hybrid models combining the agent-based and the metapopulation approaches according to the available data and computational resources.",29-Jun,2010,10,,10.1186/1471-2334-10-190,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-190
"Castella, JC; Trung, TN; Boissau, S","Participatory simulation of land-use changes in the northern mountains of Vietnam: the combined use of an agent-based model, a role-playing game, and a geographic information system",ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,"In Vietnam, the remarkable economic growth that resulted from the doi moi ( renovation) reforms was based largely on the rural households that had become the new basic unit of agricultural production in the early 1990s. The technical, economic, and social changes that accompanied the decollectivization process transformed agricultural production, resource management, land use, and the institutions that defined access to resources and their distribution. Combined with the extreme biophysical, technical, and social heterogeneity encountered in the northern mountains, these rapid changes led to the extreme complexity of the agrarian dynamics that today challenges traditional diagnostic approaches. Since 1999, a participatory simulation method has been developed to disentangle the cause-and-effect relationships between the different driving forces and changes in land use observed at different scales. Several tools were combined to understand the interactions between human and natural systems, including a narrative conceptual model, an agent-based spatial computational model ( ABM), a role-playing game, and a multiscale geographic information system (GIS). We synthesized into an ABM named SAMBA-GIS the knowledge generated from the above tools applied to a representative sample of research sites. The model takes explicitly into account the dynamic interactions among: ( 1) farmers' strategies, i.e., the individual decision-making process as a function of the farm's resource profile; ( 2) the institutions that define resource access and usage; and ( 3) changes in the biophysical and socioeconomic environment. The next step consisted of coupling the ABM with the GIS to extrapolate the application of local management rules to a whole landscape. Simulations are initialized using the layers of the GIS, e. g., land use in 1990, accessibility, soil characteristics, etc., and statistics available at the village level, e. g., population, ethnicity, livestock, etc. At each annual time step, the agrarian landscape changes according to the decisions made by agent-farmers about how to allocate resources such as labor force, capital, and land to different productive activities, e. g., crops, livestock, gathering of forest products, off-farm activities. The participatory simulations based on SAMBA-GIS helped identify villages with similar land-use change trajectories to which the same types of technical and/or institutional innovations could be applied. Scenarios of land-use changes were developed with local stakeholders to assess the potential impact of these changes on the natural resource base and on agricultural development. This adaptive approach was gradually refined through interactions between researchers and the local population.",JUN,2005,10,1,,
"Evans, TP; Kelley, H",Multi-scale analysis of a household level agent-based model of landcover change,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"Scale issues have significant implications for the analysis of social and biophysical processes in complex systems. These same scale implications are likewise considerations for the design and application of models of landcover change. Scale issues have wide-ranging effects from the representativeness of data used to validate models to aggregation errors introduced in the model structure. This paper presents an analysis of how scale issues affect an agent-based model (ABM) of landcover change developed for a research area in the Midwest, USA. The research presented here explores how scale factors affect the design and application of agent-based landcover change models. The ABM is composed of a series of heterogeneous agents who make landuse decisions on a portfolio of cells in a raster-based programming environment. The model is calibrated using measures of fit derived from both spatial composition and spatial pattern metrics from multi-temporal landcover data interpreted from historical aerial photography. A model calibration process is used to find a best-fit set of parameter weights assigned to agents' preferences for different landuses (agriculture, pasture, timber production, and non-harvested forest). Previous research using this model has shown how a heterogeneous set of agents with differing preferences for a portfolio of landuses produces the best fit to landcover changes observed in the study area. The scale dependence of the model is explored by varying the resolution of the input data used to calibrate the model (observed landcover), ancillary datasets that affect land suitability (topography), and the resolution of the model landscape on which agents make decisions. To explore the impact of these scale relationships the model is run with input datasets constructed at the following spatial resolutions: 60, 90, 120, 150, 240, 300 and 480 in. The results show that the distribution of landuse-preference weights differs as a function of scale. In addition, with the gradient descent model fitting method used in this analysis the model was not able to converge to an acceptable fit at the 300 and 480 m spatial resolutions. This is a product of the ratio of the input cell resolution to the average parcel size in the landscape. This paper uses these findings to identify scale considerations in the design, development, validation and application of ABMs of landcover change. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We developed a model of Ebola virus transmission that integrates detailed geographical and demographic data from Liberia to overcome the limitations of non-spatial approaches in projecting the disease dynamics and assessing non-pharmaceutical control interventions. Methods We modelled the movements of individuals, including patients not infected with Ebola virus, seeking assistance in health-care facilities, the movements of individuals taking care of patients infected with Ebola virus not admitted to hospital, and the attendance of funerals. Individuals were grouped into randomly assigned households (size based on Demographic Health Survey data) that were geographically placed to match population density estimates on a grid of 3157 cells covering the country. The spatial agent-based model was calibrated with a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. The model was used to estimate Ebola virus transmission parameters and investigate the effectiveness of interventions such as availability of Ebola treatment units, safe burials procedures, and household protection kits. Findings Up to Aug 16,2014, we estimated that 38.3% of infections (95% CI 17.4-76.4) were acquired in hospitals, 30.7% (14.1-46.4) in households, and 8.6% (3.2-11.8) while participating in funerals. We noted that the movement and mixing, in hospitals at the early stage of the epidemic, of patients infected with Ebola virus and those not infected was a sufficient driver of the reported pattern of spatial spread. The subsequent decrease of incidence at country and county level is attributable to the increasing availability of Ebola treatment units (which in turn contributed to drastically decreased hospital transmission), safe burials, and distribution of household protection kits. Interpretation The model allows assessment of intervention options and the understanding of their role in the decrease in incidence reported since Sept 7,2014. High-quality data (eg, to estimate household secondary attack rate, contact patterns within hospitals, and effects of ongoing interventions) are needed to reduce uncertainty in model estimates.",FEB,2015,15,2,10.1016/S1473-3099(14)71074-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(14)71074-6
"Benenson, Itzhak; Martens, Karel; Birfir, Slava",PARKAGENT: An agent-based model of parking in the city,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,"In this paper, we present PARKAGENT, an agent-based, spatially explicit model for parking in the city. Unlike traditional parking models, PARKAGENT simulates the behavior of each driver in a spatially explicit environment and is able to capture the complex self-organizing dynamics of a large collective of parking agents within a non-homogeneous (road) space. The model generates distributions of key values like search time, walking distance, and parking costs over different driver groups. It is developed as an ArcGIS application, and can work with a practically unlimited number of drivers. The advantages of the model are illustrated using a real-life case from Tel Aviv. Taking detailed data from field surveys, the model is used to study the impact of additional parking supply in a residential area with a shortage of parking places. The PARKAGENT model shows that additional parking supply linearly affects the occurrence of extreme values, but has only a weak impact on the average search time for a parking place or the average walking distance between the parking place and the destination.

We show that this macro-level implication of network structure depends on hidden micro-level assumptions. Using a computational model similar to earlier studies, we find that ties between clusters facilitate cultural convergence under the micro-level assumptions of assimilation and attraction to similar others. However, these assumptions also have negative counterparts-differentiation and xenophobia.

One major reason of this success, besides this conceptual facility, can be found in the support provided by the development of increasingly powerful software platforms, which now allow modelers without a strong background in computer science to easily and quickly develop their own models. Another trend observed in the latest years is the development of much more descriptive and detailed models able not only to better represent complex systems, but also answer more intricate questions. In that respect, if all agent-based modeling platforms support the design of small to mid-size models, i.e. models with little heterogeneity between agents, simple representation of the environment, simple agent decision-making processes, etc., very few are adapted to the design of large-scale models. GAMA is one of the latter. It has been designed with the aim of supporting the writing (and composing) of fairly complex models, with a strong support of the spatial dimension, while guaranteeing non-computer scientists an easy access to high-level, otherwise complex, operations.

"Arsanjani, Jamal Jokar; Helbich, Marco; Vaz, Eric De Noronha",Spatiotemporal simulation of urban growth patterns using agent-based modeling: The case of Tehran,CITIES,"Rapid urban growth is becoming a serious problem in most developing countries. Tehran, the capital of Iran, stands out as a vibrant metropolitan area, facing uncontrolled urban expansion. Public authorities and decision makers require planning criteria regarding possible spatial developments. To monitor past developmental trends and to simulate emerging spatiotemporal patterns of urban growth, this research applies a geosimulation approach that couples agent-based modeling with multicriteria analysis (MCA) for the period between 1986 and 2006. To model the major determinants controlling urban development, three agent groups are defined, namely developer agents, government agents, and resident agents. The behaviors of each agent group are identified by qualitative surveys and are considered separately using multi-criteria analysis. The interactions of the agents are then combined through overlay functions within a Geographic Information System (GIS). This analysis results in the creation of a propensity surface of growth that is able to identify the most probable sites for urban development. Subsequently, a Markov Chain Model (MCM) and a concise statistical extrapolation are used to determine the amount of probable future expansion in Tehran. For validation purposes, the model is estimated using 2011 data and then validated based on actual urban expansion. Given the accurate predictions of the Markov Chain Model, further predictions were carried out for 2016 and 2026. This simulation provides strong evidence that during the next decade planning authorities will have to cope with continuous as well as heterogeneously distributed urban growth. Both the monitoring of growth and simulation revealed significant developments in the northwestern part of Tehran, continuing toward the south along the interchange networks.

The system implements econometric and statistical models that represent travel and decision-making behavior throughout the evacuation process. The system considers six typical evacuation decisions: evacuate/stay, accommodation type choice, evacuation destination choice, mode choice, vehicle usage choice, and departure time choice. It explicitly captures the shadow evacuation population. In addition, the model system captures pre-evacuation preparation activities using an activity-based approach. A demonstration study that predicts activity-travel patterns using model parameters estimated for the Miami-Dade area for a hypothetical category-4 hurricane is discussed. The simulation results clearly indicate the model system produces a distribution of choice patterns that is consistent with sample observations and existing literature. The model system also identifies the proportion of the shadow evacuation population and their geographical extent. About 23% of the population outside the designated evacuation zone would evacuate. The shadow evacuation demand is mainly located within 5 km of the coastline. The output demand of the model system works with agent-based traffic simulation tools and conventional trip-based simulation tools. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The spread of diseases like influenza depends on the mixing patterns within the population, and these mixing patterns depend in part on local factors including the spatial distribution and age structure of the population, the distribution of size and composition of households, employment status and commuting patterns of adults, and the size and age structure of schools. Finally, public health planners must take into account the health behavior patterns of the population, patterns that often vary according to socioeconomic factors such as race, household income, and education levels. Results: FRED (a Framework for Reconstructing Epidemic Dynamics) is a freely available open-source agent-based modeling system based closely on models used in previously published studies of pandemic influenza. This version of FRED uses open-access census-based synthetic populations that capture the demographic and geographic heterogeneities of the population, including realistic household, school, and workplace social networks. FRED epidemic models are currently available for every state and county in the United States, and for selected international locations. Conclusions: State and county public health planners can use FRED to explore the effects of possible influenza epidemics in specific geographic regions of interest and to help evaluate the effect of interventions such as vaccination programs and school closure policies. FRED is available under a free open source license in order to contribute to the development of better modeling tools and to encourage open discussion of modeling tools being used to evaluate public health policies.

"Castella, Jean-Christophe; Verburg, Peter H.",Combination of process-oriented and pattern-oriented models of land-use change in a mountain area of Vietnam,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"The tools and methods developed by different scientific communities to simulate the dynamics of land use have emphasised either processes or patterns of changes. Agent-based models (ABM) belong to the former category while many spatially explicit simulation models belong to the latter. These two different modelling approaches were jointly implemented at a study site in Vietnam to assess their respective strengths and weaknesses with respect to their capacity to support the formulation of land-use policy and to influence decision making by multiple groups of stakeholders. SAMBA is a people-centred approach combining an ABM, a role-playing game and a geographic information system. Participatory simulations help elicit the rules of the ABM and calibrate the model, while the model supports the participatory exploration of land-use change scenarios over longer time periods. CLUE-s is a spatial simulation model which explores changes in land-use patterns within user-specified rules of permissible change and rates of change. Driving factors that influence changes from one land-use type to another are defined by combining spatially explicit data on land use and supposed driving factors in a logistical regression analysis. Alternatively, the decision rules that were revealed during the participatory simulations - with the role plays and the multi-agent modelling of the SAMBA approach - were incorporated in the CLUE-s model to provide more realistic estimates for the varying influence of land-use drivers. We checked the respective validity of the two models by applying them at the same site and comparing their outputs. As a result, no single approach was obviously superior according to the validation statistics. The three approaches turned out to be complementary in simulating land-use patterns, while providing different types of information. Integration of the two models into a rule-based version of CLUE-s helped reconciling data-driven statistical models and process-driven agent-based models in LUCC research.

"O'Sullivan, D; Haklay, M",Agent-based models and individualism: is the world agent-based?,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE,"Agent-based models (ABMs) are an increasingly popular tool in the social sciences. This trend seems likely to continue, so that they will become widely used in geography and in urban and regional planning. We present an overview of examples of these models in the life sciences, economics, planning, sociology, and archaeology. We conclude that ABMs strongly tend towards an individualist view of the social world. This point is reinforced by closer consideration of particular examples. This discussion pays attention to the inadequacy of an individualist model of society with reference to debates in social theory. We argue that because models are closed representations of an open world it is important that institutions and other social structures be explicitly included, or that their omission be explained. A tentative explanation for the bias of ABMs is offered, based on an examination of early research in artificial intelligence and distributed artificial intelligence from which disciplines the approach is derived. Some implications of these findings are discussed. We indicate some useful research directions which are beginning to tackle the individualism issue directly. We further note that the underlying assumptions of ABMs are often hidden in the implementation details. We conclude that such models must be subject to critical examination of their assumptions, and that model builders should engage with social theory if the approach is to realise its full potential.",AUG,2000,32,8,10.1068/a32140,http://dx.doi.org/10.1068/a32140
"Groff, Elizabeth R.",Simulation for theory testing and experimentation: An example using routine activity theory and street robbery,JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY,"Achieving a better understanding of the crime event in its spatio-temporal context is an important research area in criminology with major implications for improving policy and developing effective crime prevention strategies. However, significant barriers related to data and methods exist for conducting this type of research. The research requires micro-level data about individual behavior that is difficult to obtain and methods capable of modeling the dynamic, spatio-temporal interaction of offenders, victims, and potential guardians at the micro level. This paper presents simulation modeling as a method for addressing these challenges. Specifically, agent-based modeling, when integrated with geographic information systems, offers the ability to model individual behavior within a real environment. The method is demonstrated by operationalizing and testing routine activity theory as it applies to the crime of street robbery. Model results indicate strong support for the basic premise of routine activity theory; as time spent away from home increases, crime will increase. The strength of the method is in providing a research platform for translating theory into models that can be discussed, shared, tested and enhanced with the goal of building scientific knowledge.",JUN,2007,23,2,10.1007/s10940-006-9021-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-006-9021-z
"Pontius, Robert Gilmore, Jr.; Peethambaram, Smitha; Castella, Jean-Christophe","Comparison of Three Maps at Multiple Resolutions: A Case Study of Land Change Simulation in Cho Don District, Vietnam",ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS,"Geographic modelers frequently compare maps of observed land transitions to maps of simulated land transitions to relate the patterns in reference maps to the output from a simulation model. Pixel-by-pixel analysis of raster maps at a single resolution is useful for this task at a single scale, but scientists often need to consider additional scales. This article presents methods to satisfy this need by proposing a multiple-resolution method to compare land categories in three maps: a reference map of time 1, a reference map of time 2, and a simulation map of time 2. The method generates a three-dimensional table that gives the percentage of the study area for each combination of categories at the maps' native resolution and at several nested sets of coarser squares. The method differentiates allocation disagreement within coarse squares, allocation disagreement among coarse squares, quantity disagreement, and agreement. We illustrate the method with output from a run of the SAMBA agent-based model from 1990 to 2001 using 32-m resolution pixels for Cho Don District, Vietnam. Results show that half of the overall disagreement is attributable to allocation disagreement within squares that are 506 m x 506 m, which is about the average size of a village. Much of the remaining disagreement is misallocation of forest and shrub between the northern and southern parts of the district, which is caused by differences between the data and the simulation concerning transitions from the crop and shrub categories.",,2011,101,1,10.1080/00045608.2010.517742,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00045608.2010.517742

Diez",An Agent-Based Model of Income Inequalities in Diet in the Context of Residential Segregation,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE,"Background: Low dietary quality is a key contributor to obesity and related illnesses, and lower income is generally associated with worse dietary profiles. The unequal geographic distribution of healthy food resources could be a key contributor to income disparities in dietary profiles. Purpose: To explore the role that economic segregation can have in creating income differences in healthy eating and to explore policy levers that may be appropriate for countering income disparities in diet. Methods: A simple agent-based model was used to identify segregation patterns that generate income disparities in diet. The capacity for household food preferences and relative pricing of healthy foods to overcome or exacerbate the differential was explored. Results: Absent other factors, income differentials in diet resulted from the segregation of high-income households and healthy food stores from low-income households and unhealthy food stores. When both income groups shared a preference for healthy foods, low-income diets improved but a disparity remained. Both favorable preferences and relatively cheap healthy foods were necessary to overcome the differential generated by segregation. Conclusions: The model underscores the challenges of fostering favorable behavior change when people and resources are residentially segregated and behaviors are motivated or constrained by multiple factors. Simulation modeling can be a useful tool for proposing and testing policies or interventions that will ultimately be implemented in a complex system where the consequences of multidimensional interactions are difficult to predict.

These ideas are reviewed briefly and then set in the wider context of the application of entropy in a range of disciplines. Related developments since 1970 are examined with particular reference to extensions of the core model, links to mathematical programming, the relationship to economics, and the introduction of a dynamic spatial structure hypothesis. The role of entropy maximizing in geography, and more widely in complexity science, is reviewed and two conclusions are drawn beyond the continued effective deployment of entropy models: geography could be a leading player as complexity science develops; and geography can use these ideas to update the presentation of its classic theories. The ongoing research agenda is extensive-particularly in relation to the modeling of imperfect markets in economics-in its links with network science and agent-based modeling. Recent developments in physics suggest a new role for entropy in understanding spatial structure. This article is organized into five main sections.

"Chen, XW; Meaker, JW; Zhan, FB",Agent-based modeling and analysis of hurricane evacuation procedures for the Florida Keys,NATURAL HAZARDS,"The unique geography of the Florida Keys presents both high risk of hurricane landfall and exceptional vulnerability to the effects of a hurricane strike. Inadequate hurricane shelters in the Keys make evacuation the only option for most residents, but the sole access road can become impassable well in advance of a major storm. These extraordinary conditions create challenges for emergency managers who must ensure that appropriate emergency plans are in place and to ensure that an orderly exodus can occur without stranding large numbers of people along an evacuation route with inadequate shelter capacity. This study attempts to answer two questions: (1) What is the minimum clearance time needed to evacuate all residents participating in an evacuation of the Florida Keys in advance of a major hurricane for 92,596 people - a population size calculated based on the 2000 US Census population data, census undercounts, and the number of tourists estimated to be in the area? (2) If a hurricane makes landfall in the Keys while the evacuation is in progress, how many residents will need to be accommodated if the evacuation route becomes impassable? The authors conducted agent-based microsimulations to answer the questions. Simulation results suggest that it takes 20 h and 11 min to 20 h and 14 min to evacuate the 92,596 people. This clearance time is less than the Florida state mandated 24-h clearance time limit. If one assumes that people evacuate in a 48-h period and the traffic flow from the Keys would follow that observed in the evacuation from Hurricane Georges, then a total of 460 people may be stranded if the evacuation route becomes impassable 48 h after an evacuation order is issued. If the evacuation route becomes impassable 40 h after an evacuation order is issued, then 14,000 people may be stranded.",JUL,2006,38,3,10.1007/s11069-005-0263-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-005-0263-0

In particular, we adapt and integrate different social submodels, models of urban dynamics, water consumption, and technological and opinion diffusion, in an agent-based model that is, in turn, linked with a geographic information system. The result is a computational environment that enables simulating and comparing various water demand scenarios. We have parameterized our general model for the metropolitan area of Valladolid (Spain). The model shows the influence of urban dynamics (e.g., intrapopulation movements, residence typology, and changes in the territorial model) and other socio-geographic effects (technological and opinion dynamics) in domestic water demand. The conclusions drawn in this way would have been difficult to obtain using other approaches, such as conventional forecasting methods, given the need to integrate different socioeconomic and geographic aspects in one single model. We illustrate that the described methodology can complement conventional approaches, providing descriptive and formal additional insights into domestic water demand management problems.",2-May,2009,45,,10.1029/2007WR006536,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007WR006536
"Piguet, Etienne; Kaenzig, Raoul; Guelat, Jeremie",The uneven geography of research on environmental migration,POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT,"Climate change and environmental hazards affect the entire world, but their interactions with-and consequences on-human migration are unevenly distributed geographically. Research on climate and migration have their own geographies which do not necessarily coincide. This paper critically confronts these two geographies by presenting the first detailed mapping of research in the field of environmentally induced migration. After a brief review of the geography of research on climate change, the paper presents an overview of nearly 50 years of case studies on the basis of CliMig, a bibliographic database of 1193 scientific papers and books on climate/environmental change and migration, among them 463 empirical case studies. We analyze the locations of these case studies, the academic affiliations of their researchers, and the origin of their funding. Mapping the locations of case studies worldwide points toward blind spots in the research and identifies overstudied areas. We describe the methodologies used in the studies and present a typology of environmental hazards. Our results show that research on environmental migration is mainly done in countries of the Global South, whereas climate science research in general is focused on countries of the Global North. We contend that the peculiar geography of environmental migration cannot be explained solely by the uneven vulnerability of southern populations to the environment. It must also be understood through the lens of post-colonial and securitization studies as the result of a framing of environmental refugees (and refugees in general) as an intrinsically southern problem and as a security risk for the North. This paper is an original contribution to the literature on the North-South divide in scientific research and will help to outline future directions of investigation.",JUN,2018,39,4,10.1007/s11111-018-0296-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11111-018-0296-4

This paper uses an empirical, geographic information system (GIS)-integrated agent-based model of residential solar photovoltaic (PV) adoption to explore the importance of using empirical household-level data and of incorporating economic as well as social and behavioral factors on model outcomes. Our goal is to identify features of the model that are most critical to successful prediction of the temporal, spatial, and demographic patterns that characterize the technology adoption process for solar PV. Agent variables, topology, and environment are derived from detailed and comprehensive real-world data between 2004 and 2013 in Austin (Texas, USA). Four variations of the model are developed, each with a different level of complexity and empirical characterization. We find that while an explicit focus only on the financial aspects of the solar PV adoption decision performs well in predicting the rate and scale of adoption, accounting for agent-level attitude and social interactions are critical for predicting spatial and demographic patterns of adoption with high accuracy.

From the recycling/reusing perspective, a key enabler towards CE is Industrial Symbiosis (IS). Although IS has been widely applied in manufacturing industries, its implementation is unclear in the construction industry. Particularly, the potential IS economic convenience is hard to predict in the highly fragmented construction supply chain. This study explores the IS based on the Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RCA) in the context of a concrete waste supply chain in the Twente region of the Netherlands. The research tackles with the CE challenge of lacking economic incentives by investigating the Industrial Symbiosis Network (ISN) emerged by replacing Primary Concrete Aggregates (PCA) with RCA. An Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) approach is proposed by integrating Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to present the dynamic supply-demand of RCA. Besides, supply chain actors are simulated as negotiable agents in a platform model to reveal the IS collaboration dynamics under different economic scenarios. It is found that the IS exists in the construction industry but only in an implicit manner because the RCA treatment requires the collaboration of multiple actors across substantial temporal and spatial differences. The study enriches the IS taxonomy by defining Implicit IS and provides instruments to support the decision-making of business collaborations and policy-making for a circular construction industry.

We find that even in Los Angeles, a geographically spread out city, the price of EVs is a more significant barrier to adoption than EV range. In fact, even a quintupling of battery size at no additional costs improves EV adoption by only 5 %.

Specifically, we develop two models to evaluate the movement between classes of compliant and noncompliant taxpayers. Our analysis suggests that the effect on compliance of changing enforcement levels depends on whether the taxpayer population is initially compliant or noncompliant. Compliant populations are insensitive to changes in enforcement policies until enforcement becomes sufficiently lax, when we observe a sudden shift to high levels of noncompliance in equilibrium. In contrast, relatively noncompliant populations respond to increased enforcement by gradually increasing compliance. Then, when enforcement becomes sufficiently harsh, we find a sudden shift in equilibrium to very high levels of compliance. After the taxpayer population shifts from compliance to noncompliance, or vice versa, our models predict that returning to the previous enforcement policy will not cause the population to return to its previous state. On the whole, our models' results help explain why taxpayer compliance varies across time and across geographic regions, even under similar enforcement regimes.",JAN,2003,78,1,10.2308/accr.2003.78.1.39,http://dx.doi.org/10.2308/accr.2003.78.1.39

Traditional literature on innovation diffusion has been dominated by models of aggregate behavior and trends. However, the agent-based modeling (ABM) paradigm is gaining popularity as it captures agent heterogeneity and enables fine-grained modeling of interactions mediated by social and geographic networks. While most ABM work on innovation diffusion is theoretical, empirically grounded models are increasingly important, particularly in guiding policy decisions. We present a critical review of empirically grounded agent-based models of innovation diffusion, developing a categorization of this research based on types of agent models as well as applications. By connecting the modeling methodologies in the fields of information and innovation diffusion, we suggest that the maximum likelihood estimation framework widely used in the former is a promising paradigm for calibration of agent-based models for innovation diffusion.

Poor sanitation and housing conditions contribute to frequent incidents of cholera outbreaks within this camp. We model the spread of cholera by explicitly representing the interaction between humans and their environment, and the spread of the epidemic using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model. Results from the model show that the spread of cholera grows radially from contaminated water sources and seasonal rains can cause the emergence of cholera outbreaks.

"Fraccascia, Luca; Yazan, Devrim Murat",The role of online information-sharing platforms on the performance of industrial symbiosis networks,RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING,"From technical perspective, an important condition for developing industrial symbiosis (IS) is the match between waste supply and demand. Such a match is hampered by lack of information among companies, i.e., demand (supply) for waste exists but firms producing (requiring) that waste are not aware of such a demand (supply). Despite online information-sharing platforms are proposed to support the creation of industrial symbiosis networks (ISNs), related environmental and economic benefits are not in-depth investigated. This paper firstly aims to fill this gap. Although up-to-date literature recognizes lack of information-sharing as an IS barrier, in-depth analysis about the impact of sensitive information-sharing on the operations of IS is not addressed. This paper secondly aims at filling this gap. In this paper, we design an agent-based model to simulate the emergence and operations of self-organized ISNs in three scenarios: (1) no information-sharing platform; (2) a platform where companies provide information about their geographical location and the type and quantity of produced and required wastes; (3) a platform where companies provide sensitive information about the costs of operating IS. These scenarios are simulated in a numerical case study involving two kinds of IS businesses: (1) marble residuals used in concrete production; (2) alcohol slops used in fertilizer production. Results show that online platforms increase the economic and environmental performance of ISNs. Findings help practitioners to understand the importance of information-sharing and to clarify whether the information they consider as 'sensitive' is really sensitive or it is non-sensitive information that facilitates business-making.",SEP,2018,136,,10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.03.009,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.03.009

The social relationships of sperm whales are organized in a multilevel society with an upper level composed of clans of individuals communicating using similar patterns of clicks (codas). Using agent-based models informed by an 18-year empirical study, we show that clans are unlikely products of stochastic processes (genetic or cultural drift) but likely originate from cultural transmission via biased social learning of codas. Distinct clusters of individuals with similar acoustic repertoires, mirroring the empirical clans, emerge when whales learn preferentially the most common codas (conformism) from behaviourally similar individuals (homophily). Cultural transmission seems key in the partitioning of sperm whales into sympatric clans.

"Turner, A",Analysing the visual dynamics of spatial morphology,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN,"Recently there has been a revival of interest in visibility analysis of architectural configurations. The new analyses rely heavily on computing power and statistical analysis, two factors which, according to the postpositivist school of geography, should immediately cause us to be wary. The danger, they would suggest, is in the application of a reductionist formal mathematical description in order to 'explain' multilayered sociospatial phenomena. The author presents an attempt to rationalise how we can use visibility analysis to explore architecture in this multilayered context by considering the dynamics that lead to the visual experience. In particular, it is recommended that we assess the visual process of inhabitation, rather than assess the visibility in vacuo. In order to investigate the possibilities and limitations of the methodology, an urban environment is analysed by means of an agent-based model of visual actors within the configuration. The results obtained from the model are compared with actual pedestrian movement and other analytic measurements of the area: the agents correlate well both with human movement patterns and with configurational relationship as analysed by space-syntax methods. The application of both methods in combination improves on the correlation with observed movement of either, which in turn implies that an understanding of both the process of inhabitation and the principles of configuration may play a crucial role in determining the social usage of space.",SEP,2003,30,5,10.1068/b12962,http://dx.doi.org/10.1068/b12962

We suggest a four-dimensional framework (4P) that includes reporting on dimensions of (1) the Purpose for selecting a PM approach (the why); (2) the Process by which the public was involved in model building or evaluation (the how); (3) the Partnerships formed (the who); and (4) the Products that resulted from these efforts (the what).

"Crooks, Andrew T.; Wise, Sarah",GIS and agent-based models for humanitarian assistance,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,"Natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis occur all over the world, altering the physical landscape and often severely disrupting people's daily lives. Recently researchers' attention has focused on using crowds of volunteers to help map the damaged infrastructure and devastation caused by natural disasters, such as those in Haiti and Pakistan. This data is extremely useful, as it is allows us to assess damage and thus aid the distribution of relief, but it tells us little about how the people in such areas will react to the devastation. This paper demonstrates a prototype spatially explicit agent-based model, created using crowdsourced geographic information and other sources of publicly available data, which can be used to study the aftermath of a catastrophic event. The specific case modelled here is the Haiti earthquake of January 2010. Crowdsourced data is used to build the initial populations of people affected by the event, to construct their environment, and to set their needs based on the damage to buildings. We explore how people react to the distribution of aid, as well as how rumours relating to aid availability propagate through the population. Such a model could potentially provide a link between socio-cultural information about the people affected and the relevant humanitarian relief organizations. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"Northridge, Mary E.; Metcalf, Sara S.",Enhancing implementation science by applying best principles of systems science,HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS,"Background: Implementation science holds promise for better ensuring that research is translated into evidence-based policy and practice, but interventions often fail or even worsen the problems they are intended to solve due to a lack of understanding of real world structures and dynamic complexity. While systems science alone cannot possibly solve the major challenges in public health, systems-based approaches may contribute to changing the language and methods for conceptualising and acting within complex systems. The overarching goal of this paper is to improve the modelling used in dissemination and implementation research by applying best principles of systems science. Discussion: Best principles, as distinct from the more customary term 'best practices', are used to underscore the need to extract the core issues from the context in which they are embedded in order to better ensure that they are transferable across settings. Toward meaningfully grappling with the complex and challenging problems faced in adopting and integrating evidence-based health interventions and changing practice patterns within specific settings, we propose and illustrate four best principles derived from our systems science experience: (1) model the problem, not the system; (2) pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable; (3) leverage the utility of models as boundary objects; and (4) adopt a portfolio approach to model building. To improve our mental models of the real world, system scientists have created methodologies such as system dynamics, agent-based modelling, geographic information science and social network simulation. To understand dynamic complexity, we need the ability to simulate. Otherwise, our understanding will be limited. The practice of dynamic systems modelling, as discussed herein, is the art and science of linking system structure to behaviour for the purpose of changing structure to improve behaviour. A useful computer model creates a knowledge repository and a virtual library for internally consistent exploration of alternative assumptions. Conclusion: Among the benefits of systems modelling are iterative practice, participatory potential and possibility thinking. We trust that the best principles proposed here will resonate with implementation scientists; applying them to the modelling process may abet the translation of research into effective policy and practice.",4-Oct,2016,14,,10.1186/s12961-016-0146-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12961-016-0146-8

We used the invasive pentatomid, Halyomorpha halys, as the model organism because gaps in knowledge exist regarding its developmental physiology, it is expanding its global distribution, and it is of significant economic importance. Model predictions were compared against field observations over 3 years, and the parameter set that enables the largest population growth was applied to eight locations over 10 years, capturing the variation in temperature and photoperiod profiles of significant horticultural crop production that could be affected by H. halys in the US. As a species that overwinters as adults, critical photoperiod significantly impacted H. halys seasonality and population size through its influence on diapause termination and induction, and this may impact other insects with similar life-histories. Photoperiod and temperature interactions influenced life stage synchrony among years, resulting in an order of magnitude difference, for occurrence of key life stages. At all locations, there was a high degree of overlap among life stages and generation. Although all populations produced F-2 adults and thus could be characterized as bivoltine, the size and relative contribution of each generation to the total, or overwintering, adult population also varied dramatically. In about half of the years in two locations (Geneva, NY and Salem, OR), F-1 adults comprised half or more of the adult population at the end of the year. Yearly degree-day accumulation was a significant covariate influencing variation in population growth, and average maximum adult population size varied by 10-fold among locations. Average final population growth was positive (Asheville, NC, Homestead, FL, Davis, CA) or marginal (Geneva, NY, Bridgeton, NJ, Salem, OR, Riverside, CA), but was negative in one location (Wenatchee WA) due to cooler temperatures coupled with timing of vitellogenesis of F-2 adults.

"Khan, Hassaan Furqan; Yang, Y. C. Ethan; Xie, Hua; Ringler, Claudia",A coupled modeling framework for sustainable watershed management in transboundary river basins,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"There is a growing recognition among water resource managers that sustainable watershed management needs to not only account for the diverse ways humans benefit from the environment, but also incorporate the impact of human actions on the natural system. Coupled natural-human system modeling through explicit modeling of both natural and human behavior can help reveal the reciprocal interactions and co-evolution of the natural and human systems. This study develops a spatially scalable, generalized agent-based modeling (ABM) framework consisting of a process-based semi-distributed hydrologic model (SWAT) and a decentralized water system model to simulate the impacts of water resource management decisions that affect the food-water-energy-environment (FWEE) nexus at a watershed scale. Agents within a river basin are geographically delineated based on both political and watershed boundaries and represent key stakeholders of ecosystem services. Agents decide about the priority across three primary water uses: food production, hydropower generation and ecosystem health within their geographical domains. Agents interact with the environment (streamflow) through the SWAT model and interact with other agents through a parameter representing willingness to cooperate. The innovative two-way coupling between the water system model and SWAT enables this framework to fully explore the feedback of human decisions on the environmental dynamics and vice versa. To support non-technical stakeholder interactions, a web-based user interface has been developed that allows for role-play and participatory modeling. The generalized ABM framework is also tested in two key transboundary river basins, the Mekong River basin in Southeast Asia and the Niger River basin in West Africa, where water uses for ecosystem health compete with growing human demands on food and energy resources. We present modeling results for crop production, energy generation and violation of eco-hydrological indicators at both the agent and basin-wide levels to shed light on holistic FWEE management policies in these two basins.",12-Dec,2017,21,12,10.5194/hess-21-6275-2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-6275-2017

Modelling the spatio-temporal behaviour of individuals requires new representational forms that capture how organisms store and use spatial information. New procedures must be developed that simulate how individuals produce bounded knowledge of geographical space through experiential learning, adapt this knowledge to continually changing environments, and apply it to spatial decision-making processes.

It accounted for 32.8% of the final energy consumption of Croatia in 2011 making it the second most energy demanding sector. Because of their higher efficiency, a modal switch from conventional ICE (internal combustion engines) to EVs(electric vehicles) has the potential to greatly reduce the overall energy demand of the transport sector. Our previous work has shown that a transition to EVs in a combination with a modal split from air and road to rail transport can reduce the energy consumption in Croatia by 99 PJ, which is approximately 59%, by the year 2050 when compared to the business as usual scenario. The goal of this paper is to model the hourly distribution of the energy consumption of EVs and use the calculated load curves to test their impact on the Croatian energy system.

"Bishop, ID","Assessment of visual qualities, impacts, and behaviours, in the landscape, by using measures of visibility",ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN,"The application of information technology to landscape analysis dates back to the early work in computer-based mapping. Indeed, much of the early development of what became geographic information systems (GIS) and three-dimensional landscape simulation was undertaken by landscape architects. Mapping of viewsheds quickly became a key element of the landscape-planning process. The process was applied to determination of both view characteristics and potential visual impacts. The algorithms for viewshed analysis were incorporated into ISIS products at an early stage in their evolution, but have evolved very little since despite the identification of significant potential enhancements. Extension of the simple binary mapping of GIS has therefore depended on specific developments by individual researchers. These GIS extensions have generated models of visual quality and visual impact using mapped variables. More recently it has become apparent that the essentially two-dimensional approach to view analysis afforded by GIS is inadequate in situations with strong three-dimensional elements. The upsurge in agent-based modeling has demanded a new standard in computer-based visual interpretation of landscape.

The objective in these studies is to simulate the current and projected movement of individuals in relationship to pedestrian infrastructure or management actions to determine the impact on visitor experience and infrastructure capacity. A number of projects have been undertaken in Australia and the United States using agent-based models. However, research has shown that there is a need for new methods to collect calibration and validation data in order to validate spatial/temporal simulation models. This paper presents the results of experiments designed to track humans at the Twelve Apostles National Park, Victoria, Australia over 3 days in an effort to develop typologies of trip itineraries. The research used running race timing equipment known as the Alge timing system to monitor the movement of people in the park along a constrained network. A series of receivers recorded the precise positions of 900 individuals who were wearing unobtrusive ankle transmitters. This paper examines the technical aspects of tracking humans using race-timing technology and proposes some methods to analyse this data to determine whether typologies of tourist behaviour do indeed exist. The research also comments on the utility of the data to address the requirements of the recreational behaviour simulator, an agent-based modeling framework which has been used extensively for national park management.

The RHEA (Risks and Hedonics in Empirical Agent-based land market) model captures natural hazard risks and environmental amenities through hedonic analysis, facilitating empirical agent-based land market modeling. RHEA is well grounded in economic theory and uses rich spatial data and econometric analysis. It moves beyond the existing work by explicitly simulating the emergence of property prices and their spatial distribution under adaptive price expectations of heterogeneous agents, advancing toward empirical modeling of agent-based land markets. At the same time RHEA operates in a realistic GIS landscape where realtor and households agents form ask and bid prices using empirical hedonic price functions. The simulation results demonstrate that this combination of theoretically sound micro-foundations in agents' behavior and empirical data is feasible.

Agent-based models have become a popular tool for simulating movement, allowing experimentation with scenarios in computer models that might not be amenable to real-world investigation. The fidelity of agent-based movement models is naturally most acute when the models driving their synthetic characters reproduce the geography of their behaviors appropriately: by placing people in the right places, at the right times, doing the right things, in the right contexts. Most simulation environments for moving agent pedestrians, however, rely on simple, abstract physical heuristics to drive synthetic characters and they focus on generating plausible coarse-grained movement patterns, which might not always map to real-world pedestrian behavior. Moreover, existing approaches often produce serious mechanical artifacts in simulation. I contend that agent-based models of pedestrian movement can benefit more fully from a comprehensive infusion of realistic movement behavior and I present the case for, and proven usefulness of, a geographic engine for driving synthetic actors in simulation. Whereas many existing approaches use particle physics, my approach is sourced in theory and observation, modeling lower, medium-, and higher level behavioral geographies for perceiving and sorting objects, route planning and wayfinding, orientation and locomotion, physical steering, mediating interactions, and determining the space and time for scheduling and realizing activities, with the results that the scheme that I present can automatically generate realistic-looking and realistic-behaving synthetic pedestrians for experimentation.",,2012,102,1,10.1080/00045608.2011.595658,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00045608.2011.595658

Results from our scenario experiments computationally verified literature that show large lot-size zoning policies lead to greater sprawl, and large lot-size zoning policies can lead to increased forest cover, although we found this effect to be small relative to municipal land acquisition. The return on land acquisition for forest conservation was strongly affected by the location strategy used to select parcels for conservation. Furthermore, the location strategy for forest conservation land acquisition was more effective at increasing aggregate forest levels than the independent zoning policies, the quantity of area acquired for forest conservation, and any combination of the two.

However, few studies have investigated the effects of governmental regulation and human activity on the optimal allocation of land for different uses. Crucially, the non-optimal use of land by urban decision-makers leads to multiple problems including wasting potential land resources and trade-offs between economic development and environmental protection. Therefore, in this study, we developed a multi-spatial agent-based optimisation model (MSABOM) coupled with a multi-agent system (MAS) within a machine-learning framework. The MSABOM determines spatially optimised land-use solutions based on the small-scale land-use preferences of stakeholders, and addresses conflicts in the sub-optimal allocation of resources based on the behaviours of model agents and the decision-making environment. The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in China was used as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. The results show that (1) the MSABOM can significantly improve the optimisation of PLES, improving the land utilisation rate by 1.22 times; (2) based on an understanding of existing practices, the optimal allocation plan obtained by the agent-based model is more suitable than that obtained by a non-agent-based model; (3) multi-functional land-use patterns can be optimally allocated in space and time, which is extremely useful for coordinating stakeholder participation and addressing conflicts of interest in land-use behaviours; and (4) an urban spatial development coefficient was successfully used to determine the dominant function and functional positioning of PLES, which helps ensure flexible development strategies for spatial planning.",1-Dec,2020,437,,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109310,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109310

The trajectories of urban growth can be monitored and modeled by the use of geographic information system techniques, remote sensing data, and statistical analysis. In this study, we couple game theory with an integrated agent-cellular method to develop a model of the major determinants controlling urban development, which not only accounts for socioeconomic driving forces but also captures human actions. Wuhan, the largest city in central China, is undergoing rapid urbanization and is facing uncontrolled urban expansion. The city proper region of Wuhan is selected as the case study area to simulate urban growth during the period between 2003 and 2023. The results indicate that the social conflicts between the different stakeholders in urban development can be identified by utilizing a game tree. The game-theory based agent-cellular model is shown to be more effective than a pure cellular automata model in urban growth simulation. The results also show that, from 2013 to 2023, the urban area of the Wuhan city proper region is predicted to grow to 442.77 km(2), which is almost two times the area in 2003. This research is the first study to use empirical data and game theory to analyze the decision-making process in urban development in the Wuhan area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Two explanations have been proposed for this result: The first is that the troop surge worked by increasing counterinsurgent capacity, whereas the second argument is that ethnic unmixing and the establishment of relatively homogenous enclaves were responsible for declining violence in Baghdad through reducing contact. We address this question using an agent-based model that is built on GIS-coded data on violence and ethnic composition in Baghdad. While we cannot fully resolve the debate about the effectiveness of the surge, our model shows that patterns of violence and segregation in Baghdad are consistent with a simple mechanism of ethnically motivated attacks and subsequent migration. Our modeling exercise also informs current debates about the effectiveness of counterinsurgency operations. We implement a simple policing mechanism in our model and show that even small levels of policing can dramatically mitigate subsequent levels of violence. However, our results also show that the timing of these efforts is crucial; early responses to ethnic violence are highly effective, but quickly lose impact as their implementation is delayed.",MAR,2013,57,1,10.1111/isqu.12059,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/isqu.12059

We argue that current pressing global environmental problems, such as land grabs, loss of critical carbon sinks and the increasing importance of corporate actors in land-use decision-making, necessitate a reconsideration of neoclassical conceptualizations of what the economy is, who economic actors are and how they make decisions, and how environment-economy linkages operate in a globalized world. We argue that concepts from economic geography can help land change science move beyond neoclassical framings. The first concept is that the economic (including markets, commodities, and rational decision-makers) is neither separate nor universal, but is historical and socially embedded. The second is to use these notions to understand the spatial organization of economic activity. The framework of global production networks, in particular, will help land change scientists conceptualize and represent teleconnections. Using economic geography to move beyond neoclassical economic framings will bring a fresh approach to economic change that holds much promise for invigorating land change science.

Here, we discuss the integrated socio-ecological model SERD (Simulation of Ecological Compatibility of Regional Development) that was developed for the municipality of Reichraming in Upper Austria in a participative 2-year process involving local stakeholders. SERD includes three main components: (1) an agent-based actors module that simulates decisions of farmsteads, the municipal administration and other important actors; (2) a spatially explicit (GIS based) land-use module that simulates land-use change at the level of individual parcels of land and (3) an integrated socio-ecological stock-flow module that simulates carbon and nitrogen flows through both socioeconomic and ecological system compartments. We report on outcomes of a scenario analysis that outlines possible future trajectories depending on both external (e.g. agricultural subsidies and prices) and internal (e.g. innovation, willingness to co-operate) factors. We find that both external and internal factors can affect the behaviour of the integrated system considerably. Local and regional policies are found to be able to counteract adverse global socioeconomic conditions to some extent, but not to reverse the trend altogether. We also find strong interdependencies between socioeconomic and ecological components of the system.

For this population, maintaining a diet consisting of nutritious foods is complicated by a number of physical and social barriers. In cities, a coalescence of social, spatial, and economic factors influence the availability of healthy food in any given place. The urban food environment contextualizes the structural and individual-level norms that drive daily decision-making about what to eat. Understanding and acting on the processes that reduce these residents' access to healthy foods will make for a healthier urban landscape. This paper advances the discussion of food deserts by using an agent-based model to simulate the impact of various policy interventions on low-income households' consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables. Using a simulated population of low-income households in Buffalo, NY, initialized with demographic and geographic data from the US Census and the City of Buffalo, a baseline scenario is established. Four different scenarios are explored in contrast to the baseline, including increasing the frequency that households shop for groceries, increasing the probability convenience stores stock fresh produce, and implementing a mobile market distribution system. The paper concludes by analyzing the effectiveness of the varying strategies, and discussing policy implications. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Most research activities so far have concentrated on either extending complexity theory to spatially explicit phenomena, or on designing computational models and software tools. Only a few of these activities have focused on using ABMS for spatially explicit modeling of real-world policy scenarios. In this paper we present a realistic application of ABMS to simulating alternative futures for a small community in Washington State, USA.

Typically, computational models are therein used to interpret qualitative future storylines in terms of quantitative future changes. This paper addresses these challenges and illustrates some of the advantages of a scenario-based approach using an Agent-Based Model (ABM). Storylines are shown to be useful in integrate a broad variety of knowledge sources, such as subjective expert judgement and results from other (integrative) models, which rely on a similar set of assumptions about the future. The advantages of ABMs are demonstrated for interpreting future scenarios in the context of spatial and temporal variations in socio-ecological outcomes based on heterogeneous individual behaviour. For example, ABMs are shown to enable potential hotspots of future development and LUCC to be identified. Furthermore, a procedure is presented for downscaling and interpreting storylines from general qualitative trends to local quantitative parameters within an ABM framework. This framework is applied to the Municipality of Koper, Slovenia, where the future impacts of LUCC on the loss of agricultural land and residential quality-of-life are simulated. The results are compared to a business-as-usual baseline and it is shown that industrial and commercial development has the greatest impact on the loss of high quality agricultural land across all scenarios. Furthermore, the model indicates an increase in inequality in the perceived quality-of-life of residential households, with new households achieving higher quality-of-life than existing residents.

"Brown, A. G.","Geoarchaeology, the four dimensional (4D) fluvial matrix and climatic causality",GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Geoarchaeology is the application of geological and geomorphological techniques to archaeology and the study of the interactions of hominins with the natural environment at a variety of temporal and spatial scales. Geoarchaeology in the UK over the last twenty years has flourished largely because it has gone beyond technological and scientific applications. Over the same period our ability to reconstruct the 3-dimensional stratigraphy of fluvial deposits and the matrix of fluvial sites has increased dramatically because of a number of technological advances. These have included the use of LiDAR (laser imaging) and radar to produce high-resolution digital surface models, the use of geophysics, particularly ground penetrating radar and electrical resistivity. to produce sediment depth models, and the use of GIS and data visualisation techniques to manipulate and display the data. These techniques along with more systematic and detailed sedimentological recording of exposed sections have allowed the construction of more precise 3-dimensional (volumetric) models of the matrix of artefacts within fluvial deposits. Additionally a revolution in dating techniques, particularly direct sediment dating by luminescence methods, has enabled the creation of 4-dimensional models of the creation and preservation of these sites. These 4-dimensional models have the ability to provide far more information about the processes of site creation, preservation and even destruction, and also allow the integration of these processes with independent data sources concerning cultural evolution and climatic change. All improvements in the precision of dating fluvial deposits have archaeological importance in our need to translate events from a sequential or geological timeframe to human timescales. This allows geoarchaeology to make a more direct contribution to cultural history through the recognition of agency at the individual or group level. This data can then form a component of biocomplexity or agent-based modelling which is becoming increasingly used in the natural sciences, particularly ecology and geomorphology and which can be used to test scenarios including the impact on, and response of, hominins to abrupt or catastrophic environmental change. Whilst catastrophic events clearly represent the atypical they can be illuminating in revealing cognitive processes resulting in abandonment. coping. mitigation and innovation. These points are exemplified using two in-depth case studies: one from the Holocene geoarchaeological record of the River Trent in Central England and the other from the Palaeolithic record from rivers in South West Britain. In the former the interaction between climate change and human activity is illustrated at the year to century timescale whilst in the other the timescale is millennial. These case studies have deliberately been chosen to be as different as possible in temporal and spatial scale with the aim of examining the applicability of methodological and theoretical aspects of geoarchaeology. Lastly the paper considers the problem of scale in geoarchaeology, and concludes it is process-dependency, which ultimately affects the questions we can ask, and that questions of human response to climate change are fundamentally a product of materiality and cognitive processes. This demands an in-depth contextual approach to such questions rather than database-driven assertions of causality. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Due to weak connections with the mainland and the power grid, the diversity of island energy demand leads to high economic costs and envi-ronmental pollution issues. This study proposes a 100% renewable island energy system, which integrates with power-to-gas, combined cooling, heating and power, and desalination technologies to supply electricity, heating, cooling, gas and fresh water to the local residents. A comprehensive approach for energy demand prediction, system design and dispatch optimization, as well as system evaluation is proposed. For energy demand pre-diction, agent-based modeling is used to simulate the demand of electricity, heating, cooling, gas and fresh water for the case study community on the island. The k-means clustering and scenario tree are further adopted to generate representative stochastic scenarios, which are applied to capture the uncertainty of energy demand. A multi-objective optimization model is developed to optimize the system design and scheduling strategy simul-taneously. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and to evaluate the obtained optimal solutions for the case study, different objectives and extreme weather conditions are specifically considered. The optimal solution obtained shows that compared to battery storage, a 2.5% annual cost reduction can be achieved by using power-to-gas technology for energy storage. The findings also suggest that extreme weather conditions can be coped with by increasing the capacity of biogas generation, desalination, and energy storage equipment, thereby improving the resilience of the island energy system.",15-Feb,2022,308,,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118376,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118376

The main methodology is a newly developed agent-based model that incorporates empirical data about the mobility behavior of the citizens in order to calculate the traveled routes, the resulting traffic and subsequent emissions. To assess the impact of different policies on CO2 emissions, different scenarios are simulated and their results are compared to a base line scenario. The model features a local and temporal resolution, effects like congestion and stop-and-go traffic as well as commuters to and from other regions. In addition to the evaluation of certain policies (like a focus on electric cars, telecommuting or an improvement of the road infrastructure), a method is provided, that makes it possible to compare many diverse scenarios, featuring technological changes, societal changes or changes in the road network, all within the same framework. The findings suggest that one of the most promising strategies to decrease urban CO2 emissions is to focus on the use of electric cars, especially if it is combined with offering alternatives to private car traffic and incentives for telecommuting. Banning the use of old cars only yields a significant result if a large amount of cars is affected, which would make such a policy difficult to implement. Expanding the road network has no significant positive effect and may even encourage using cars, therefore leading to even more CO2 emissions. Due to its flexible structure the presented model can be used to evaluate policies beyond what is presented in this study. It can easily be adapted to other conditions and geographical regions.

Moreover, the ABM accounts for the effect of social interactions among agents who share identical home and work geographic locations. Finally, GIS-based maps are developed at block group resolution that allows examining the effect of walk-bike infrastructure related investments. The results from New York City case study indicate that infrastructure investments such as widening sidewalk and increasing bike lane network can positively influence the active transportation mode choices.

Using insights from negotiation theories, we analyze specifically the influence of spatial representations on the way people interacted, discussed and learnt from each other in the participatory modelling process. We argue that models that are spatially too explicit and realistic can actually impede the exploration of innovative and integrative scenarios in which ecological, social and economic objectives are mutually enriching. Indeed, spatial representations might lead to think in terms of boundaries and segregated space, and therefore prevent from thinking in terms of multifunctional space and from finding innovative and integrative solutions.

Many ABM studies have focused at the scale of villages, rural landscapes, towns or cities. When considering a geographical, spatially-explicit domain, current ABM architecture is generally not easily translatable to a regional or global context, nor does it acknowledge SESs interactions across scales sufficiently; the model extent is usually determined by pragmatic considerations, which may well cut across dynamical boundaries. With a few exceptions, the internal structure of governments is not included when representing them as agents. This is partly due to the lack of theory about how to represent such as actors, and because they are not static over the time-scales typical for social changes to have significant effects. Moreover, the relevant scale of analysis is often not known a priori, being dynamically determined, and may itself vary with time and circumstances. There is a need for ABM to cross the gap between micro-scale actors and larger-scale environmental, infrastructural and political systems in a way that allows realistic spatial and temporal phenomena to emerge; this is vital for models to be useful for policy analysis in an era when global crises can be triggered by small numbers of micro-level actors.

Methods for the quantification of flood risk are well established, but tend to deal with human and economic vulnerability as being static or changing with an exogenously defined trend.

The ABM has been developed to firstly allow an analysis of the vulnerability of homeowners to surface water flooding, which is one of the greatest short-term climate risks in the UK with estimated annual costs of 1.3bn pound to 2.2bn pound. These costs have been estimated to increase by 60-220% over the next 5 0 years due to climate change and urbanisation. Vulnerability is influenced by homeowner's decisions to move house and/or installmeasures to protect their properties from flooding. In particular, the ABM focuses on the role of flood insurance, simulating the current public-private partnership between the government and insurers in the UK, and the forthcoming re-insurance scheme Flood Re, designed as a roadmap to support the future affordability and availability of flood insurance. The ABM includes interaction between homeowners, sellers and buyers, an insurer, a local government and a developer. Detailed GIS and qualitative data of the London borough of Camden are used to represent an area at high risk of surface water flooding. The ABM highlights how future development can exacerbate current levels of surface water flood risk in Camden. Investment in flood protection measures are shown to be beneficial for reducing surface water flood risk. The Flood Re scheme is shown to achieve its aim of securing affordable flood insurance premiums, however, is placed under increasing pressure in the future as the risk of surface water flooding continues to increase.",31-Jan,2017,20,1,10.18564/jasss.3135,http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.3135

We present an agent-based EV ecosystem model that incorporates EV adoption and usage with spatial and temporal considerations and that can aid different EV industry stakeholders such as policymakers, utility operators, charging station planners, and EV manufacturers. The model follows an ecological modeling approach, and is used to determine how different policies and battery technologies affect EV adoption, EV charging, and charging station activity. We choose model parameters to fit San Francisco as a test city and simulate different scenarios. The results provide insight on potential changes to the San Francisco EV ecosystem as a result of changes in rebates, availability of workplace charging, public awareness of lower EV operational costs, and denser EV batteries. We find that our results match those obtained using other approaches and that the compact geographical size of San Francisco and its relative wealth make it an ideal city for EV adoption.

"Verstegen, Judith Anne; Karssenberg, Derek; van der Hilst, Floor; Faaij, Andre",Spatio-temporal uncertainty in Spatial Decision Support Systems: A case study of changing land availability for bioenergy crops in Mozambique,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,"Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSSs) often include models that can be used to assess the impact of possible decisions. These models usually simulate complex spatio-temporal phenomena, with input variables and parameters that are often hard to measure. The resulting model uncertainty is, however, rarely communicated to the user, so that current SDSSs yield clear, but therefore sometimes deceptively precise outputs. Inclusion of uncertainty in SDSSs requires modeling methods to calculate uncertainty and tools to visualize indicators of uncertainty that can be understood by its users, having mostly limited knowledge of spatial statistics. This research makes an important step towards a solution of this issue. It illustrates the construction of the PCRaster Land Use Change model (PLUC) that integrates simulation, uncertainty analysis and visualization. It uses the PCRaster Python framework, which comprises both a spatio-temporal modeling framework and a Monte Carlo analysis framework that together produce stochastic maps, which can be visualized with the Aguila software, included in the PCRaster Python distribution package. This is illustrated by a case study for Mozambique in which it is evaluated where bioenergy crops can be cultivated without endangering nature areas and food production now and in the near future, when population and food intake per capita will increase and thus arable land and pasture areas are likely to expand. It is shown how the uncertainty of the input variables and model parameters effects the model outcomes. Evaluation of spatio-temporal uncertainty patterns has provided new insights in the modeled land use system about, e.g., the shape of concentric rings around cities. In addition, the visualization modes give uncertainty information in an comprehensible way for users without specialist knowledge of statistics, for example by means of confidence intervals for potential bioenergy crop yields. The coupling of spatio-temporal uncertainty analysis to the simulation model is considered a major step forward in the exposure of uncertainty in SDSSs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Community-associated (CA) MRSA strains primarily cause skin and soft tissue infections, but may also cause life-threatening invasive infections. First seen in Australia and the U.S., it is a growing problem around the world. The U.S. has had the most widespread CA-MRSA epidemic, with strain type USA300 causing the great majority of infections. Individuals with either asymptomatic colonization or infection may transmit CA-MRSA to others, largely by skin-to-skin contact. Control measures have focused on hospital transmission. Limited public health education has focused on care for skin infections. Methods: We developed a fine-grained agent-based model for Chicago to identify where to target interventions to reduce CA-MRSA transmission. An agent-based model allows us to represent heterogeneity in population behavior, locations and contact patterns that are highly relevant for CA-MRSA transmission and control. Drawing on nationally representative survey data, the model represents variation in sociodemographics, locations, behaviors, and physical contact patterns. Transmission probabilities are based on a comprehensive literature review. Results: Over multiple 10-year runs with one-hour ticks, our model generates temporal and geographic trends in CA-MRSA incidence similar to Chicago from 2001 to 2010. On average, a majority of transmission events occurred in households, and colonized rather than infected agents were the source of the great majority (over 95%) of transmission events. The key findings are that infected people are not the primary source of spread. Rather, the far greater number of colonized individuals must be targeted to reduce transmission. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that current paradigms in MRSA control in the United States cannot be very effective in reducing the incidence of CA-MRSA infections. Furthermore, the control measures that have focused on hospitals are unlikely to have much population-wide impact on CA-MRSA rates. New strategies need to be developed, as the incidence of CA-MRSA is likely to continue to grow around the world.",12-May,2014,12,,10.1186/1479-5876-12-124,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5876-12-124
"Linard, Catherine; Poncon, Nicolas; Fontenille, Didier; Lambin, Eric F.",A multi-agent simulation to assess the risk of malaria re-emergence in southern France,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"A multi-agent simulation (MAS) was developed to assess the risk of malaria re-emergence in the Camargue in southern France, a non-endemic area where mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles (Culicidae) live. The contact rate between people and potential malaria vectors, or the human biting rate, is one of the key factor to predict the risk of re-emergence of malaria, would the parasite be introduced in the region. Our model (called MALCAM) represents the different agents that could influence malaria transmission in the Camargue people, mosquitoes, animal hosts and the landscape - in a spatially explicit environment. The model simulates spatial and temporal variations in human biting rate at the landscape scale. These variations depend on the distribution of people and potential vectors, their behaviour and their interactions. A land use/cover map was used as a cellular-spatial support for the movements of and interactions between mobile agents. The model was tested for its sensitivity to variations in parameter values, and for the agreement between field observations and model predictions. The MALCAM model provides a tool to better understand the interactions between the multiple agents of the disease transmission system, and the land use and land cover factors that control the spatial heterogeneity in these interactions. It allows testing hypotheses and scenarios related to disease dynamics by varying the value of exogenous biological, geographical, or human factors. This application of agent-based modelling to a human vector-borne disease can be adapted to different diseases and regions.

"Evans, Tom P.; Kelley, Hugh",Assessing the transition from deforestation to forest regrowth with an agent-based model of land cover change for south-central Indiana (USA),GEOFORUM,"The Midwest and Northeast United States has experienced a net increase in forest cover since the beginning of the 20th century. However, we lack a detailed understanding of the transition to net forest cover increase because this forest regrowth occurred prior to the use of tools like household-level surveys focused on land use decision-making and availability of remote sensing data. Agent-based modeling presents an appealing means to explore what social and biophysical dynamics may have contributed to this forest regrowth process. In this paper we employ an agent-based model to analyze the process of forest regrowth in south-central Indiana from 1939 to 1993. Simulation results are presented for assumptions regarding pre-existing forest age and the stand age at which landowners harvest timber with a goal of understanding the influence of these factors on future trajectories of land cover change. The results demonstrate both the value and the burden of having many time points to evaluate the success of the model. Is the best simulation the one with the smallest net residuals across all time points? Or is the best simulation the one that best reproduces the correct trajectory of land cover change for each time interval? Model simulations that assume a harvesting frequency of 30 years all produced landscapes within 2% of the actual forest cover in 1993, the end point of the study period. However, the trajectories of these simulations did not all mimic the gradual forest regrowth found in our observed data. The model simulation with the smallest residual values across all time points assumed a initial forest age of 5 years in 1939 and a harvesting frequency of 30 years. Ultimately, we cannot definitively conclude that one model simulation is a better representation of reality than another because we have no way of comprehensively validating the model assumptions. However, we can more plausibly conclude that the age of forest regrowth in 1939 and the frequency of timber harvesting by landowners both had an influence on the successive trajectory of land cover change in the study area.

Such models are limited in their ability to model individual behaviour and geographical influences. Heppenstall et al presented a novel agent-based framework for modelling individual petrol stations as agents and integrated important additional system behaviour through the use of established methodologies such as spatial interaction models. The parameters for this model were initially determined by the use of real data analysis and experimentation. This paper explores the parameterisation and verification of the model through data analysis and by use of a genetic algorithm (GA). The results show that a GA can be used to produce not just an optimised match, but results that match those derived by expert analysis through rational exploration.

In this context, characterized by scarce resources and increasing demand for mobility, Demand Responsive Shared Transport (DRST) services can bridge the gap between shared low-quality public transport and unsustainable individual private transport. Taking advantage of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), they can supply transport solutions ranging from flexible transit to ride sharing services, providing real-time on demand mobility through fleets of vehicles shared by different passengers. The optimal design of a DRST service requires a trade-off among efficiency (from the operators' point of view), service quality (from the users' point of view) and sustainability (from the community's point of view). In this paper, an agent based model (ABM) fed with GIS data is used to explore different system configurations of a specific type of DRST service, i.e. flexible transit, and to estimate the transport demand and supply variables that make the service feasible and convenient. The model reproduces a mixed fixed/flexible route transit service with different fleet size and vehicle capacity in the city of Ragusa (Italy) with the aim to: (i) make a first test of the ABM model with GIS-based demand and road network models; (ii) explore different vehicle dispatching strategies; (iii) find appropriate indicators to monitor the service quality and efficiency. Simulation results show the impact of fleet composition and route choice strategy on the system performance. In particular, they show an optimal range of operating vehicles that minimizes a total unit cost indicator, accounting both for passenger travel time and vehicle operation cost. By reproducing the microinteraction between demand and supply agents (i.e. passengers and vehicles), it is possible to monitor the macroscopic behaviour of the system, and derive useful suggestions for the correct planning, management and optimization of DRST services.",MAR,2019,73,,10.1016/j.retrec.2018.11.009,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.retrec.2018.11.009
"Gonzalez de Durana, Jose Maria; Barambones, Oscar; Kremers, Enrique; Varga, Liz",Agent based modeling of energy networks,ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT,"Attempts to model any present or future power grid face a huge challenge because a power grid is a complex system, with feedback and multi-agent behaviors, integrated by generation, distribution, storage and consumption systems, using various control and automation computing systems to manage electricity flows. Our approach to modeling is to build upon an established model of the low voltage electricity network which is tested and proven, by extending it to a generalized energy model. But, in order to address the crucial issues of energy efficiency, additional processes like energy conversion and storage, and further energy carriers, such as gas, heat, etc., besides the traditional electrical one, must be considered. Therefore a more powerful model, provided with enhanced nodes or conversion points, able to deal with multidimensional flows, is being required. This article addresses the issue of modeling a local multi-carrier energy network. This problem can be considered as an extension of modeling a low voltage distribution network located at some urban or rural geographic area. But instead of using an external power flow analysis package to do the power flow calculations, as used in electric networks, in this work we integrate a multiagent algorithm to perform the task, in a concurrent way to the other simulation tasks, and not only for the electric fluid but also for a number of additional energy carriers. As the model is mainly focused in system operation, generation and load models are not developed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We use a combination of observed and recorded real-world movement trajectory samples in conjunction with synthetic, agent-generated, movement as inputs to a machine-learning scheme. This scheme produces movement behavior for non-sampled scenarios in simulation, for applications that can differ widely from the original collection settings. It does this by benchmarking a simulated pedestrian's relative behavioral geography, local physical environment, and neighboring agent-pedestrians; using spatial analysis, spatial data access, classification, and clustering. The scheme then weights, trains, and tunes likely synthetic movement behavior, per-agent, per-location, per-time-step, and per-scenario. To prove its usefulness, we demonstrate the task of generating synthetic, non-sampled, agent-based pedestrian movement in simulated urban environments, where the scheme proves to be a useful substitute for traditional transition-driven methods for determining agent behavior. The potential broader applications of the scheme are numerous and include the design and delivery of location-based services, evaluation of architectures for mobile communications technologies, what-if experimentation in agent-based models with hypotheses that are informed or translated from data, and the construction of algorithms for extracting and annotating space-time paths in massive data-sets.",JUL,2011,15,,10.1111/j.1467-9671.2011.01261.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9671.2011.01261.x

Yet, PDR is the most poorly understood phase of the disaster management cycle and can take years or even decades. The physical aspects of the recovery are relatively easy to monitor and evaluate using, e.g. geospatial remote sensing data compared to functional assessments that include social and economic processes. Therefore, there is a need to explore the impacts of different dimensions of the recovery, including individual behaviour and their interactions with socio-economic institutions. In this study, we develop an agent-based model to simulate and explore the PDR process in urban areas of Tacloban, the Philippines devastated by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. Formal and informal (slum) sector households are differentiated in the model to explore their resilience and different recovery patterns. Machine learning-derived land use maps are extracted from remote sensing images for pre- and post-disaster and are used to provide information on physical recovery. We use the empirical model to evaluate two realistic policy scenarios: the construction of relocation sites after a disaster and the investments in improving employment options. We find that the speed of the recovery of the slum dwellers is higher than formal sector households due to the quick reconstruction of slums and the availability of low-income jobs in the first months after the disaster. Finally, the results reveal that the households' commuting distance to their workplaces is one of the critical factors in households' decision to relocate after a disaster.",15-Jun,2021,60,,10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102285,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102285

"Mao, Liang","Modeling triple-diffusions of infectious diseases, information, and preventive behaviors through a metropolitan social network-An agent-based simulation",APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,"A typical epidemic often involves the transmission of a disease, the flow of information regarding the disease, and the spread of human preventive behaviors against the disease. These three processes diffuse simultaneously through human social networks, and interact with one another, forming negative and positive feedback loops in the complex human-disease systems. Few studies, however, have been devoted to coupling all the three diffusions together and representing their interactions. To fill the knowledge gap, this article proposes a spatially explicit agent-based model to simulate a triple-diffusion process in a metropolitan area of 1 million people. The individual-based approach, network model, behavioral theories, and stochastic processes are used to formulate the three diffusions and integrate them together. Compared to the observed facts, the model results reasonably replicate the trends of influenza spread and information propagation.

Contrarily to the widely shared consensus on the importance of evaluating outcome uncertainty, little attention has been given to the role a well-structured spatially explicit sensitivity analysis (SSA) of LULC models can play in corroborating model results. In this article, I propose a methodology for SSA that employs sensitivity indices (SIs), which decompose outcome uncertainty and allocate it to various combinations of inputs. Using an agent-based model of residential development, I explore the utility of the methodology in explaining the uncertainty of simulated land use change. Model sensitivity is analyzed using two approaches. The first is spatially inexplicit in that it applies SI to scalar outputs, where outcome land use maps are lumped into spatial statistics. The second approach, which is spatially explicit, employs the maps directly in SI calculations. It generates sensitivity maps that allow for identifying regions of factor influence, that is, areas where a particular input contributes most to the clusters of residential development uncertainty.

Census data show that these effects are nontrivial in relation to the magnitude of decadal changes in residential segregation. An agent-based model illustrates the potential long-run impacts of rising numbers of mixed-race households on measures of neighborhood-scale segregation. It reveals that high rates of mixed-race household formation will reduce residential segregation considerably. This occurs even when preferences for own-group neighbors are high enough to maintain racial separation in residential space in a Schelling-type model. We uncover a disturbing trend, however; levels of neighborhood-scale segregation of single-race households can remain persistently high even while a growing number of mixed-race households drives down the overall rate of residential segregation. Thus, the article's main conclusion is that parsing neighborhood segregation levels by household type-single versus mixed race-is essential to interpret correctly trends in the spatial separation of racial groups, especially when the fraction of households that are mixed race is dynamic.

However, it remains unclear how these factors would influence the diffusion and further the associated urban elements (e.g., infrastructures) at the micro scale. In response, this paper tried to quantify the influence of two types of cost-related factors on the adoption of Electric Vehicle (EV), namely upfront cost and usage-related cost, using purchase subsides and fuel prices as examples, respectively. An agent-based integrated micro-simulation model (SelfSim-EV) was used here to simulate how the EV market in Beijing might evolve from 2016 to 2020, within several what-if scenarios considering different Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) subsides, petrol prices and electricity prices. The results suggested that 1) doubling the PHEV subsidy would make PHEV price competitive and thus increase the PHEV sale from around zero to 2500 in 2019. The PHEV sale price increases by around 3500 RMB (from around 261,000 to 264,500 RMB) due to the increase in the PHEV penetrate rate. This further gives rise to the changes in those urban elements connected with the EV market, including the urban environment, electricity and infrastructure systems, especially at the disaggregate level; 2) both electricity and petrol prices have little influence on the adoption of EVs at the macro level (i.e. the city level), but they do influence the spatial distributions of both CV and EV owners (based on the analyses of their residential locations) and further geographical distributions of vehicular emissions, EV-related facilities (e.g., charging posts) and electricity demand of EV at multiple resolutions, ranging from the facility level to district level.

The overall ABM framework takes into account social, technical, environmental, and economic aspects to evaluate the diffusion of PV technology in the urban context. A city district that includes 18 720 households distributed over 1 290 building blocks and a surface area of 2.47 km2 is used to test the proposed ABM framework. Results show how the underlying regulatory framework (i.e., the rules of the internal electricity market) influences the pattern and intensity of adoption, thus realizing different shares of the available potential. Policies that support the establishment of 'prosumers' within Condominiums (i.e., energy community buildings), and not in single-family houses only, is key to yield high diffusion rates. The installed capacity increases by 80% by switching from the one-to-one configuration to the one-to-many paradigm, i.e., from 5.90 MW of rooftop PV installed on single-family households and/or single PV owners to 10.64 MW in energy community buildings. Moreover, the possibility to spread the auto-generated solar electricity over the load profile of the entire population of Condominium results in self-consumption rates greater than 50% and self-sufficiency ratios above 20% for the majority of the simulated buildings.",,2019,7,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2927446,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2927446

Illinois, as one of the farming states of the Midwest, has significant potential to produce bioenergy crops. Land requirements place these crops in competition with traditional agricultural uses. To understand this interaction, this study examines the spatial and economic conditions for introducing bioenergy crops into the landscape in Illinois, which varies in soil quality and climatic conditions, and therefore in the profitability of various land uses. We use a spatial dynamic model to represent the decisions of individual farmer agents who select crops to increase their income. With this dynamic, evolutionary game approach we study the changing spatial arrangement of four key crops (corn, soybeans, miscanthus and switchgrass) which is influenced by decision rules, demands, prices, subsidies and carbon credits as well as the location of ethanol plants and transportation patterns. With a growing demand for biofuels farmers adjust their priorities towards productive bioenergy crops such as switchgrass and miscanthus which result in new land-use patterns across Illinois.",,2009,39,1月2日,10.1504/IJEP.2009.027140,http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/IJEP.2009.027140

Two recent studies have demonstrated how geographically aware agent-based models can be used to provide a virtual rather than empirical laboratory for testing theory. Those studies trace the development of three versions of a basic street robbery model with different representations of routine activities (random, temporal constraints, and spatio-temporal constraints). This research uses the existing model to test whether the core premise of routine activity theory (i.e., as time away from home increases so will street robbery) holds true under the different versions of activity spaces. The findings indicate that temporal and spatial constraints have separate and unequal influences on the incidence of crime.

"Yin, Li",Assessing Walkability in the City of Buffalo: Application of Agent-Based Simulation,JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT,"Significant research has been conducted on how environmental attributes influence people's decisions to walk. In much of this research, however, environmental attributes are averaged for neighborhoods or census geographies for sampled populations. Moreover, the effect of an agent's walking choices on other actors is not adequately represented by either objective or perceived measures in the literature. Macro-level patterns of walkability arise from interactions across actors and urban environments. The agent-based approach allows for modeling individual uses of the environment by treating the populations as objects that can interact with the environment and other people. This study builds on previous research on pedestrian movement and geographic information system (GIS) measures of the built environment using the agent-based approach to explore the dynamics of the built environment and people's decision-making processes concerning walking. The results show that models that take individual perspective into account and include social interaction can better capture characteristics of the built and social environment that influence people's walking choices.

Blue water is the combination of surface runoff and deep aquifer recharge while green water is the summation of evapotranspiration and soil water content (i.e. mediated by plants). Due to the tight coupling between land use and the partitioning of blue and green water within a watershed, an integrated geospatial modeling framework that links land use and watershed hydrological processes is needed to predict the consequences of future land use change on blue versus green water security. By loosely coupling an agent based probabilistic land use change model with a hydrologic model, we investigated the consequences of present trends of urban growth to identify potential future hotspots of hydrological change across a watershed in central New Jersey undergoing sub urbanization. The agent based probabilistic model, working at the scale of land ownership parcels, predicted that future urban development would be the result of forest, rather than farm land conversion. Using existing zoning maps, the housing unit density and human population of the urban growth areas was estimated. A consequence of the loss of forest land and increasing impervious surface leading was higher blue water but lower green water. While no severe blue water scarcity was observed, an increasing green water scarcity was found in some study area sub-basins.

In this paper, we propose a simplified force-based evacuation simulation model and an easy-to-implement parallelization strategy for a large-scale microscopic tsunami evacuation simulation and demonstrate its applications in an actual urban environment. First, the simulation performance was verified and validated against experimental and observational results regarding basic pedestrian movement. The test results qualitatively and quantitatively showed good agreement with real pedestrian movements. The model was then applied to a case of tsunami evacuations in Kesennuma City, where the 2011 Tohoku tsunami caused devastating damage. The model was successfully scaled up to provide urban-scale characterization. In this application, the developed simulator was implemented by a hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelized computing technique. By utilizing the proposed model with parallel computing, we achieved an urban-scale microscopic evacuation simulation five times faster than real-time and a stochastic simulation to evaluate the uncertainty in the evacuation simulation.

Although the role of appropriate urban forms in reducing disaster vulnerability has been recognized for some time, the majority of its potential remains focused on long-term mitigation efforts. In contrast, examination of the relationships with short-term disaster management activities such as response and immediate recovery has not been thoroughly conducted. This paper contributes to this shortfall by analysing a critical type of rapid onset disaster, a near-field tsunami, and the role of urban form in supporting the populations' core response activities of evacuation and sheltering. The Chilean city of Iquique (affected by a severe earthquake and minor tsunami in 2014) is examined using a mixed methods approach that provides the basis for proposed macro-scale and micro-scale changes in its urban form; these modifications, in turn, are assessed with geographic information system (GIS) and agent-based computer models. The results show important existing evacuation vulnerability throughout major areas of the city (as the result of interrelated critical conditions), which nonetheless could be significantly reduced by the changes proposed.

Agent-based modeling (ABM) facilitates simulating spatial interactions that describe the ecological context in which insect populations spread. The main objective of this study was to develop a model of the MPB forest infestation dynamics.

Results show the direct influence that vigorous forest stands and trees have on higher breeding rates, and therefore in the MPB population increment at a tree scale, in a period of 5 years.

Continuing propagation in endemic settings and emerging regional outbreaks have indicated the need for comprehensive and coordinated HIV prevention. We describe the development of a conceptual framework and calibration of an agent-based model (ABM) to examine how combinations of interventions may reduce and potentially eliminate HIV transmission among drug-using populations. Methodology/Principal Findings: A multidisciplinary team of researchers from epidemiology, sociology, geography, and mathematics developed a conceptual framework based on prior ethnographic and epidemiologic research. An ABM was constructed and calibrated through an iterative design and verification process. In the model, agents represent IDU, NIDU, and non-drug users who interact with each other and within risk networks, engaging in sexual and, for IDUs, injection-related risk behavior over time. Agents also interact with simulated HIV prevention interventions (e. g., syringe exchange programs, substance abuse treatment, HIV testing) and initiate antiretroviral treatment (ART) in a stochastic manner. The model was constructed to represent the New York metropolitan statistical area (MSA) population, and calibrated by comparing output trajectories for various outcomes (e. g., IDU/NIDU prevalence, HIV prevalence and incidence) against previously validated MSA-level data. The model closely approximated HIV trajectories in IDU and NIDU observed in New York City between 1992 and 2002, including a linear decrease in HIV prevalence among IDUs. Exploratory results are consistent with empirical studies demonstrating that the effectiveness of a combination of interventions, including syringe exchange expansion and ART provision, dramatically reduced HIV prevalence among IDUs during this time period. Conclusions/Significance: Complex systems models of adaptive HIV transmission dynamics can be used to identify potential collective benefits of hypothetical combination prevention interventions.

"Bishop, Ian D.; Stock, Christian; Williams, Kathryn J.",Using virtual environments and agent models in multi-criteria decision-making,LAND USE POLICY,"Decision-making is often a complex task. There may be multiple criteria to be satisfied. The consequences of the available options will have different spatial and temporal distributions affecting different population groups and different generations. Decisions are also frequently made in a social context where perceptions can be as important as facts. In this complex environment, research into decision-making has two aspects: (a) understanding the decision process and (b) assisting the decision process. This paper is based on the premise that these are closely linked and that tools are possible which both help us to understand and provide support to decision-makers. A frequently requirement is determination of the trade-offs involved in complex decision situations. These are difficult to establish. Common approaches have used both stated preference and revealed preference techniques. The latter provides a better reflection of real decisions, primarily in market conditions, but does not have the level of experimental control available in hypothetical choice situations. Experimental economics has recently emerged to try to bridge this gap by providing for control of variables within a decision context made real by salient inducements. After review of these options, and the associated literature, we propose a series of linked developments in visualisation and modelling which will support: definition of non-dominated choice sets; interactive choice experiments which encompass spatial and temporal disaggregation: agent-based models to provide social context; and, visualisation to provide a greater sense of immersion in the decision context supported by more intuitive information. We have begun the integration of the necessary software into a virtual decision environment but this paper is focused on conceptual development. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This is particularly true for freight flows that are characterized by fragmentation. Logistically, this becomes apparent in vehicles that are driving around with a low vehicle fill rate, leading to the unnecessary presence of freight vehicles in our cities. This study focuses on the operational feasibility of utilizing the spare transportation capacity of a service-driven company as a potential solution to supply small independent retailers, or nanostores. The aim is to reduce inefficient vehicle movement. Based on a real-life implementation, we use SYnchronization Model for Belgian Inland Transport (SYMBIT), an agent-based model, to simulate various bundling scenarios. Results show the total vehicle kilometers and lead times to supply nanostores for the service-driven company to serve its customers. There is a potential to utilize spare capacity to supply nanostores while maintaining a decent service level. The number of vehicle kilometers driven highly depends on the location of the distribution center where the service-driven company operates. Based on these results, the conditions that have to be met to replicate this solution in other urban areas are discussed.",MAR,2018,10,3,10.3390/su10030653,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10030653
"Alghais, Nayef; Pullar, David",Modelling future impacts of urban development in Kuwait with the use of ABM and GIS,TRANSACTIONS IN GIS,"During the last six decades, Kuwait has experienced rapid and unprecedented population growth with only a small increase in the urban areas. The alarming rise in urban density in Kuwait has caused issues for the residents' lifestyles, the economy and the environment. These issues have been aggravated by urban planning which perpetuated a city-centric urban form without modelling the impacts of current patterns of urban growth. A spatial model using Agent Based Modelling (ABM) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) is proposed to model disaggregate future changes in land-use patterns given forecast population estimates and planning policies. The two main impacts considered are housing shortage and traffic congestion, as these are the two most significant social impacts for Kuwaitis. This article discusses the design methodology and parameterization of the ABM and the agent groups. It characterizes urban growth by rules for different citizen groups, historical growth patterns and the influence of decision-makers. The model is validated against data for the period 1995-2015 and simulations run to 2050; the results predict that continued city-centric growth will aggravate the problems, with more than 50% increase in housing shortage and congestion unless the government intervenes to rectify the situation.",FEB,2018,22,1,10.1111/tgis.12293,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12293

We are interested in scenarios when the information exchange among the agents is limited. This paper considers a generalization of distributed estimation to vector (non-scalar) and dynamic (non-static) cases. As we will show, when the state-vector evolves over time, the information flow over the communication network may not be fast enough to track this evolution. In this context, the key questions we address are: (i) can a distributed estimator with limited communication track an unstable system? and; (ii) what is the cutoff point beyond which the given observations and the agent topology may not result into a bounded estimation error? To address these questions, we present a scalar-gain estimator and characterize the relation between the system instability and communication/observation infrastructure. We derive and analyze the aforementioned cutoff point as the Scalar Tracking Capacity, and further show that unstable vector systems can be distributedly estimated with bounded error.

"McDonnell, Simon; Zellner, Moira",Exploring the effectiveness of bus rapid transit a prototype agent-based model of commuting behavior,TRANSPORT POLICY,"The introduction of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), typically involving the use of exclusive bus lanes and related bus priority measures, is increasingly advocated as a flexible and cost-effective way of improving the attractiveness of public transit in congested urban areas by reducing travel times and variability. These schemes typically involve the reallocation of road space for exclusive use by buses, presenting commuters with potentially competing incentives: buses on BRT routes can run faster and more efficiently than buses running in general traffic, potentially attracting commuters to public transit and reducing congestion through modal shift from cars. However, a secondary impact may also exist; remaining car users may be presented with less congested road space, improving their journey times and simultaneously acting as an incentive for some bus-users to revert to the car. To investigate the potential for these primary and secondary impacts, we develop a prototype agent-based model to investigate the nature of these interactions and how they play out into system-wide patterns of modal share and travel times. The model allows us to test the effects of multiple assumptions about the behaviors of individual agents as they respond to different incentives introduced by BRT policy changes, such as the implementation of exclusive bus lanes, increased bus frequency, pre-boarding ticket machines and express stops, separately and together. We find that, under our assumptions, these policies can result in significant improvements in terms of individual journey times, modal shift, and length of rush hour. We see that the addition of an exclusive bus lane results in significant improvements for both car users and bus riders. Informed with appropriate empirical data relating to the behavior of individual agents, the geography and the specific policy interventions, the model has the potential to aid policymakers in examining the effectiveness of different BRT schemes, applied to broader environments.

Nevertheless, disaster recovery remains understudied within the context of emergency management. Various models have been developed to address disaster recovery. However, those models neither considered the stakeholders' needs and preferences, nor the vulnerability of the host community. This paper presents a decision-making framework for disaster recovery that uses a bottom-up approach to capture the needs of the impacted residents and decreases the social vulnerability of host communities. The authors developed the following research methodology: (1) use a well-established community specific social vulnerability assessment tool to evaluate the society vulnerability; (2) model the multisector stakeholders through a root-to-grass technique that captures their objectives, strategies, and learning behaviors; (3) simulate the recovery progress of the impacted community using an agent-based simulation toolkit; and (4) interpret the results to provide the decision makers with optimal recovery strategies. The restorations efforts in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina in three coastal counties in Mississippi were used as the problem domain. Accordingly, the proposed model was implemented on a multiagent-based simulation toolkit with geographic information system (GIS) abilities. This research optimized the budget for the State Disaster Recovery Coordinator and the residents' insurance plans choices. As such, this study provided better social vulnerability indices than the existing conditions currently found in the areas under investigation. Further, this research provided higher disaster recovery rates within the studied host communities.

We explore the shift in skier distribution among ski resorts taking into account the behavioral adaptation of individuals due to the impact of climate change on snow conditions. This analysis is performed at a regional scale by means of a coupled gravity and georeferenced agent-based model. Four different scenarios are considered. Two scenarios assume an increase of winter mean temperature of +2 degrees C and +4 degrees C, respectively, taking into account only natural snow conditions. Two additional scenarios add the effect of snowmaking to enhance the natural snow depth and extend the skiing season in the +2 degrees C and +4 degrees C base scenarios. Results show differing vulnerability levels, allowing the classification of ski resorts into three distinct groups: (1) highly vulnerable ski resorts with a strong reduction in visitors attendance for all climate change scenarios, characterized by unfavorable geographical and attractiveness conditions, making it difficult to ensure snow availability in the future; (2) low vulnerability ski resorts, with moderate reduction in season length during a high climate change scenario but no reduction (or even an increase) in a low one, characterized by ski resorts with a medium capacity and attractiveness to ensure enough snow conditions and capture skiers from other ski resorts; and (3) resilient ski resorts, with good conditions to ensure future snow-reliable seasons and outstanding attractiveness, allowing them to offer longer ski seasons than their competitors and potentially attracting skiers from other closed or marginal resorts. Ski resorts included in this last group increase their skier attendance in all climate change scenarios. Although similar studies in the literature foretell a significant reduction of the ski market in the near future, another probable effect outlined in this study is a redefinition of this market due to a redistribution of skiers, from vulnerable ski resorts to more resilient ones.",2-Dec,2014,28,12,10.1080/13658816.2014.933481,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2014.933481

With rapid urbanization and lack of strategic planning, Daqing is facing many socio-economic and environmental problems, and it is essential to examine the process of urbanization, and to develop policy recommendations for sustainable development. To address this problem, this paper examined the urbanization process of Daqing City through developing two multi-level models: an integrated system dynamic (SD) and CLUE-S model (SD-CLUES), and an integrated SD and stochastic cellular automata model (SD-CA). Analysis of results suggests that these two models generate significantly different results.

"Pires, Bianica; Crooks, Andrew T.",Modeling the emergence of riots: A geosimulation approach,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,"Immediately after the 2007 Kenyan election results were announced, the country erupted in protest. Riots were particularly severe in Kibera, an informal settlement located within the nation's capital, Nairobi. Through the lens of geosimulation, an agent-based model is integrated with social network analysis and geographic information systems to explore how the environment and local interactions underlying Kibera, combined with an external trigger, such as a rumor, led to the emergence of riots. We ground our model on empirical data of Kibera's geospatial landscape, heterogeneous population, and daily activities of its residents. In order to effectively construct a model of riots, however, we must have an understanding of human behavior, especially that related to an individual's need for identity and the role rumors play on a person's decision to riot. This provided the foundation to develop the agents' cognitive model, which created a feedback system between the agents' activities in physical space and interactions in social space. Results showed that youth are more susceptible to rioting. Systematically increasing education and employment opportunities, however, did not have simple linear effects on rioting, or even on quality of life with respect to income and activities. The situation is more complex. By linking agent-based modeling, social network analysis, and geographic information systems we were able to develop a cognitive framework for the agents, better represent human behavior by modeling the interactions that occur over both physical and social space, and capture the nonlinear, reinforcing nature of the emergence and dissolution of riots.

The work concentrates on urban areas where public policies aiming at improving the sustainability of city systems necessarily affect both passengers and freight dimensions. Traffic in towns is responsible for a high share of congestion and pollution and consequently, it contributes to the climate change problems. The following conclusions can be derived. ABMs present important advantages for analysing urban transport and its sustainability but more efforts are needed in order to test and improve their use. In the literature, there is still a gap in urban transport AB modelling. The number of developed models is limited and they are often applied in broader geographical areas than urban ones. Only some of the works includes the estimation of environmental impacts as a result of certain types of agents' behaviour.

Proximity to key destinations and services is an important aspect of the urban design decision making process, particularly in areas adopting a transit-oriented development (TOD) approach to urban planning, whereby densification occurs within walking distance of transit nodes. Modeling destination access within neighborhoods has been limited to circular catchment buffers or more sophisticated network-buffers generated using geoprocessing routines within geographical information systems (GIS). Both circular and network-buffer catchment methods are problematic. Circular catchment models do not account for street networks, thus do not allow exploratory 'what-if' scenario modeling; and network-buffering functionality typically exists within proprietary GIS software, which can be costly and requires a high level of expertise to operate. Methods: This study sought to overcome these limitations by developing an open-source simple agent-based walkable catchment tool that can be used by researchers, urban designers, planners, and policy makers to test scenarios for improving neighborhood walkable catchments. A simplified version of an agent-based model was ported to a vector-based open source GIS web tool using data derived from the Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN). The tool was developed and tested with end-user stakeholder working group input. Results: The resulting model has proven to be effective and flexible, allowing stakeholders to assess and optimize the walkability of neighborhood catchments around actual or potential nodes of interest (e. g., schools, public transport stops). Users can derive a range of metrics to compare different scenarios modeled. These include: catchment area versus circular buffer ratios; mean number of streets crossed; and modeling of different walking speeds and wait time at intersections. Conclusions: The tool has the capacity to influence planning and public health advocacy and practice, and by using open-access source software, it is available for use locally and internationally. There is also scope to extend this version of the tool from a simple to a complex model, which includes agents (i.e., simulated pedestrians) 'learning' and incorporating other environmental attributes that enhance walkability (e. g., residential density, mixed land use, traffic volume).",11-Dec,2013,12,,10.1186/1476-072X-12-58,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1476-072X-12-58

These mobile agents follow particular routes: older adults who travel by car, bus, and van follow street roads, whereas pedestrians follow walkways. The model enables the user to focus on one neighborhood at a time for analysis. The spatial dimension of an older adult's accessibility to screening and treatment facilities is simulated through the travel costs (indicated by travel time or distance) incurred in the GIS-based model environment, where lower travel costs to screening and treatment facilities imply better access. This model provides a framework for representing health-seeking behavior that is contextualized by a transportation network in a GIS environment.",APR,2018,93,,10.1016/j.apgeog.2018.02.013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2018.02.013

The framework provides an overarching design that can be extended into specific model implementations to evaluate how policy, land-management preferences, and land-market dynamics affect (and are affected by) land-use and land-cover change patterns and subsequent carbon storage and flux. To demonstrate the framework, we implement a simple integration of a new agent-based model of exurban residential development and land-management decisions with the ecosystem process model BIOME-BGC. Using a stylized scenario, we evaluate the influence of different exurban residential-land-management strategies on carbon storage at the parcel level over a 48-year period from 1958 to 2005, simulating stocks of carbon in soil, litter, vegetation, and net primary productivity. Results show 1) residential parcels with management practices that only provided additions in the form of fertilizer and irrigation to turfgrass stored slightly more carbon than parcels that did not include management practices, 2) conducting no land-management strategy stored more carbon than implementing a strategy that included removals in the form of removing coarse woody debris from dense tree cover and litter from turfgrass, and 3) the removal practices modelled had a larger impact on total parcel carbon storage than our modelled additions. The degree of variation within the evaluated land-management practices was approximately 42,104 kg C storage on a 1.62 ha plot after 48 years, demonstrating the substantial effect that residential land-management practices can have on carbon storage.

In this paper the authors propose the use of complex networks for geographical modeling and demonstrate how such an application can be combined with a cellular model to produce output that is consistent with large-scale regularities such as power laws and fractality. Complex networks can provide a stringent framework for growth dynamic modeling where concepts from, for example, spatial interaction models and multiplicative growth models, can be combined with the flexible representation of land and behaviour found in cellular automata and agent-based models. In addition, there exists a large body of theory for the analysis of complex networks that have direct applications in urban geographic problems.

In particular, when used to simulate man managed systems, they allow considering human behavioural aspects within the modelling framework. On the other hand, environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has become an acknowledged tool in research, industry and policy to assess systems' environmental sustainability. More recently, LCA is being applied to assess the potential environmental impacts of large scale policy actions (e.g., actions to combat climate change). This paper describes the application of a coupled ABM-LCA model to simulate cropping activities in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The ABM considers farmers' proneness to risk, which was assessed via a naive Bayesian model trained with the results of a survey distributed to the farmers of the study region. The goal of the study is to assess the effects of the agents' interactions, that can take place in a farmers' social network, on the agricultural activities. Geographic Information System (GIS) information, national statistics and naive Bayesian model are used to parameterize agents' behaviour and interaction rules. We believe such assessment is necessary for the successful design of public adaptation strategies and subsidy schemes since governmental adaptation actions are needed to reduce emissions due to agricultural activities. Two scenarios (with different levels of farmers' environmental awareness) were simulated. The results show that the mean and variance of the distribution of farmers' environmental awareness change due to the effect of the interactions and, as a consequence, farmers' long-term decisions concerning agricultural activities are affected.

"Saeedi, Sara",Integrating macro and micro scale approaches in the agent-based modeling of residential dynamics,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,"With the advancement of computational modeling and simulation (M&S) methods as well as data collection technologies, urban dynamics modeling substantially improved over the last several decades. The complex urban dynamics processes are most effectively modeled not at the macro-scale, but following a bottom-up approach, by simulating the decisions of individual entities, or residents. Agent-based modeling (ABM) provides the key to a dynamic M&S framework that is able to integrate socioeconomic with environmental models, and to operate at both micro and macro geographical scales. In this study, a multi-agent system is proposed to simulate residential dynamics by considering spatiotemporal land use changes. In the proposed ABM, macro-scale land use change prediction is modeled by Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and deployed as the agent environment and micro scale residential dynamics behaviors autonomously implemented by household agents. These two levels of simulation interacted and jointly promoted urbanization process in an urban area of Tehran city in Iran. The model simulates the behavior of individual households in finding ideal locations to dwell. The household agents are divided into three main groups based on their income rank and they are further classified into different categories based on a number of attributes. These attributes determine the households' preferences for finding new dwellings and change with time. The ABM environment is represented by a land-use map in which the properties of the land parcels change dynamically over the simulation time. The outputs of this model are a set of maps showing the pattern of different groups of households in the city. These patterns can be used by city planners to find optimum locations for building new residential units or adding new services to the city. The simulation results show that combining macro-and micro-level simulation can give full play to the potential of the ABM to understand the driving mechanism of urbanization and provide decision-making support for urban management.",JUN,2018,68,,10.1016/j.jag.2018.02.012,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2018.02.012

Particularly in a fast developing area, the development to be simulated is seldom inertial (i.e., strictly following the historical trend); instead, it is likely to be interfered by new planning measures. Meanwhile, in such an area an optimization plan might not be even meaningful if it only addresses a snapshot of a highly dynamic landscape. In this study, we explored the possibility of integrating cellular automata (CA), a widely used method for simulating urban development and land use changes, and ant colony optimization (ACO), an advanced technique for solving complex path optimization problems. We named the resulting integrated system the geographical simulation and optimization system (GeoSOS) and applied it to a case study concerning finding the optimal path for a planned expressway in Dongguan, a fast-growing city in one of the most economically active regions of China. In the case study, the CA component of the GeoSOS generated simulations of the industrial land use changes for some years in the next decade.

"Schmit, C; Rounsevell, MDA",Are agricultural land use patterns influenced by farmer imitation?,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,"This paper proposes a methodology based solely on spatial data to analyse whether and, to what extent, farmer imitation leaves an observable footprint on an agricultural landscape. Geographical Information System (GIS) analysis of parcel and farm location data of a study region in central Belgium was developed as an alternative methodology to farmer interviews. Results suggest that imitation is not an important determinant of agricultural land use patterns in the study area. The effect of imitation on landscapes is limited to the extent of being hardly significant. Neighbouring parcels cultivated by farmers who live in close proximity are only slightly more similar than neighbouring parcels cultivated by farmers who live further away from one another. The results question the validity of the assumptions underlying agent-based models that try to explain agricultural land use through imitation behaviour. The results should, however, be considered with caution as the proposed methodology has two limitations. First, comparison between neighbouring parcels could not identify the imitation effect from all factors that influence agricultural land use. Relative space was not accounted for, which led to two possible explanations for the similarity of neighbouring parcels: imitation or the location of a parcel relative to the farm. Secondly, the method was applied to aggregated land use classes for a single year, which did not allow for the effect of crop rotations in understanding imitation behaviour. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

To motivate the investment on PCSs, this work proposes a novel framework to find the optimal location and size of PCSs, which can maximize the benefit of the investment. The impacts of charging behaviors and urban land uses on the income of PCSs are taken into account. An agent based trip chain model is used to represent the travel and charging patterns of EV owners. A cell-based geographic partition method based on Geographic Information System is employed to reflect the influence of land use on the dynamic and stochastic nature of EV charging behaviors. Based on the distributed charging demand, the optimal location and size of PCSs are determined by mixed-integer linear programming. Va euro steras, a Swedish city, is used as a case study to demonstrate the model's effectiveness. It is found that the charging demand served by a PCS is critical to its profitability, which is greatly affected by the charging behavior of drivers, the location and the service range of PCS. Moreover, charging price is another significant factor impacting profitability, and consequently the competitiveness of slow and fast PCSs. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

At present, people rarely consider the land suitability of crops when using cultivated land, resulting in an imbalance between crop distribution and resource conditions such as water, heat, and soil, and adversely affects the ecological security and utilization efficiency of cultivated land. To alleviate China's grain planting structural imbalance and efficiency loss, this paper based on the planting suitability of main food crops (rice, soybean, and maize) to adjust and optimize the cultivated land use layout (CLUL) in the typical counties of the main grain production area in Northeast China, using the agent-based model for optimal land allocation (AgentLA) and GIS technology. Findings from the study show that: (1) The planting suitability of rice, soybean, and maize in the region is obviously different. Among them, the suitability level of soybean and maize is high, and that of rice is low. The current CLUL of the food crops needs to be further optimized and adjusted. (2) By optimizing the layout of rice, soybean, and maize, the planting suitability level of the food crops and the concentration level of the CLUL spatial pattern have been improved. (3) The plan for CLULA is formulated: The study area is divided into rice stable production area, maize-soybean rotation area, maize dominant area, and soybean dominant area, and town or village is identified as the implementation unit of CLULA. The plan for CLULA will be conducive to the concentrated farming of food crops according to the suitable natural conditions and management level.

What should be the primary objective, reducing or eliminating surplus food production, requires great change within social, cultural and economic structures. The secondary approach of redistributing surplus food to areas of deficit (in terms of socio-economic groups and/or geographic regions) involves a significant logistical burden, and suffers the same issues as with the elimination of waste. The least desirable, but perhaps most practicable approach, is the use of food waste as a feedstock for Anaerobic Digestion (AD). The strategic adoption of AD can therefore be seen as an important step towards mitigating food waste, but the implementation of efficient AD systems on a large (county/region) scale involves significant complexity. The optimal number, size and location of AD plants, and whether they are centralised versus decentralised, may be determined by considering factors such as supply and proximity to feedstock, transport links, emission hazards and social impact. Reaching balanced and objective decisions when faced with such disparate criteria is inevitably very difficult. To address this problem we prototype and evaluate a decision support tool for county-scale AD planning. Our approach is a hybridised Agent Based Model (ABM) with a Multi Objective Optimisation. We capture the spatio-temporal dependencies that exist in the water, energy and food systems associated with energy derived from food waste using Agent Based Modelling (ABM). The use of Interactive Multi Criteria Analysis as visual analytics offers a means to communicate the co-benefits and trade-offs that may emerge, as well as prioritise the AD strategies, based on the prioritization of criteria. Specifically, the method supports exploration of the social, environmental and economic impact of different AD strategies and decisions, linked to current issues, namely AD scale and adoption. The results highlight a trade-off between transport costs and social acceptability for the AD centralised versus decentralised strategies. When low carbon options are weighted higher then slow, steady and aggressive decentralised strategies are the best strategic adoption of AD. Conversely, when Energy production is considered a priority, then aggressive scaling up in a centralised approach is best with slow and steady approaches being further from the ideal. The framework has demonstrated that it permits a space for dialogue and transparent prioritization of AD strategies based on WEF nexus impacts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

To understand how these factors interact to affect human survival and dispersal, we have developed a realistic agent-based model that includes geographic features, climate change, and time-varying vegetation and food resources. To enhance computational efficiency, we further apply machine learning algorithms. Our approach is new in that it is designed to systematically evaluate a large-scale agent-based model, and identify its key parameters and sensitivities. Results show that parameter interactions are the major source in generating variability in human dispersal and survival/extinction scenarios. In realistic scenarios with geographical features and time-evolving climatic conditions, random fluctuations become a major source of variability in arrival times and success. Furthermore, parameter settings as different as 92% of maximum possible difference, and occupying more than 30% of parameter space can result in similar dispersal scenarios. This suggests that historical contingency (similar causes - different effects) and equifinality (different causes - similar effects) are primary constituents of human dispersal scenarios. While paleoanthropology, archaeology and paleogenetics now provide insights into patterns of human dispersals at an unprecedented level of detail, elucidating the causes underlying these patterns remains a major challenge.

"Morgan, Fraser J.; Daigneault, Adam J.",Estimating Impacts of Climate Change Policy on Land Use: An Agent-Based Modelling Approach,PLOS ONE,"Agriculture is important to New Zealand's economy. Like other primary producers, New Zealand strives to increase agricultural output while maintaining environmental integrity. Utilising modelling to explore the economic, environmental and land use impacts of policy is critical to understand the likely effects on the sector. Key deficiencies within existing land use and land cover change models are the lack of heterogeneity in farmers and their behaviour, the role that social networks play in information transfer, and the abstraction of the global and regional economic aspects within local-scale approaches. To resolve these issues we developed the Agent-based Rural Land Use New Zealand model. The model utilises a partial equilibrium economic model and an agent-based decision-making framework to explore how the cumulative effects of individual farmer's decisions affect farm conversion and the resulting land use at a catchment scale. The model is intended to assist in the development of policy to shape agricultural land use intensification in New Zealand. We illustrate the model, by modelling the impact of a greenhouse gas price on farm-level land use, net revenue, and environmental indicators such as nutrient losses and soil erosion for key enterprises in the Hurunui and Waiau catchments of North Canterbury in New Zealand. Key results from the model show that farm net revenue is estimated to increase over time regardless of the greenhouse gas price. Net greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to decline over time, even under a no GHG price baseline, due to an expansion of forestry on low productivity land. Higher GHG prices provide a greater net reduction of emissions.

"McCreesh, Nicky; Nikulin, Grigory; Booth, Mark",Predicting the effects of climate change on Schistosoma mansoni transmission in eastern Africa,PARASITES & VECTORS,"Background: Survival and fitness attributes of free-living and sporocyst schistosome life-stages and their intermediate host snails are sensitive to water temperature. Climate change may alter the geographical distribution of schistosomiasis by affecting the suitability of freshwater bodies for hosting parasite and snail populations. Methods: We have developed an agent-based model of the temperature-sensitive stages of the Schistosoma mansoni and intermediate host snail lifecycles. The model was run using low, moderate and high warming climate projections over eastern Africa. For each climate projection, eight model scenarios were used to determine the sensitivity of predictions to different relationships between air and water temperature, and different snail mortality rates. Maps were produced showing predicted changes in risk as a result of increasing temperatures over the next 20 and 50 years. Results: Baseline model output compared to prevalence data indicates suitable temperatures are necessary but not sufficient for both S. mansoni transmission and high infection prevalences. All else being equal, infection risk may increase by up to 20% over most of eastern Africa over the next 20 and 50 years. Increases may be higher in Rwanda, Burundi, south-west Kenya and eastern Zambia, and S. mansoni may become newly endemic in some areas. Results for 20-year projections are robust to changes in simulated intermediate host snail habitat conditions. There is greater uncertainty about the effects of different habitats on changes in risk in 50 years' time. Conclusions: Temperatures are likely to become suitable for increased S. mansoni transmission over much of eastern Africa. This may reduce the impact of control and elimination programmes. S. mansoni may also spread to new areas outside existing control programmes. We call for increased surveillance in areas defined as potentially suitable for emergent transmission.",6-Jan,2015,8,,10.1186/s13071-014-0617-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-014-0617-0
"Pirotta, Enrico; New, Leslie; Harwood, John; Lusseau, David","Activities, motivations and disturbance: An agent-based model of bottlenose dolphin behavioral dynamics and interactions with tourism in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand",ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"Agent-based models can be used to simulate spatially-explicit animal behavioral processes and their interactions with human activities. This approach can be applied to predict the potential effects of such activities on animal behavior and individual condition that could lead, in turn, to alterations in vital rates and, ultimately, long-term population change. We developed an agent-based model to describe the effect of interactions with tourism on the behavior of bottlenose dolphins in Doubtful Sound (New Zealand). The model describes the temporal variation of the individuals' hidden motivational states, the way in which these states interact to determine the activity of groups of dolphins, and the feedback influence of the group's activity on individual motivations and condition. Moreover, it realistically simulates the movement of dolphin groups in the fiord. The model also includes tour boat behavior, incorporating the way key geographical features attract these boats. In addition to tourism effects, we accounted for the spatial heterogeneity in both dolphin activities and shark predation risk. The final simulation platform generated a realistic representation of the social and behavioral dynamics of the dolphin and boat populations, as well as observed patterns of disturbance. We describe how this tool could be used to ensure effective management of the interactions between anthropogenic factors and bottlenose dolphins in Doubtful Sound, and how it could be adapted to evaluate the effects of human disturbance on other comparable populations. We then fitted the dolphin component of the model to data collected during visual studies of the Doubtful Sound dolphin population between 2000 and 2002 using a Bayesian multi-state modeling framework. However, when the parameter estimates from this fitting process were used in the agent-based model, biologically realistic representations of the population were not generated. Our results suggest that visual data from group follows alone are not sufficient to inform such agent-based models. Information on the spatial structure of the animals' activities and an appropriate measure of individual condition are also required for successful model parameterization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"Millington, James D. A.; O'Sullivan, David; Perry, George L. W.",Model histories: Narrative explanation in generative simulation modelling,GEOFORUM,"The increasing use of computer simulation modelling brings with it epistemological questions about the possibilities and limits of its use for understanding spatio-temporal dynamics of social and environmental systems. These questions include how we learn from simulation models and how we most appropriately explain what we have learnt. Generative simulation modelling provides a framework to investigate how the interactions of individual heterogeneous entities across space and through time produce system-level patterns. This modelling approach includes individual- and agent-based models and is increasingly being applied to study environmental and social systems, and their interactions with one another. Much of the formally presented analysis and interpretation of this type of simulation resorts to statistical summaries of aggregated, system-level patterns. Here, we argue that generative simulation modelling can be recognised as being 'event-driven', retaining a history in the patterns produced via simulated events and interactions. Consequently, we explore how a narrative approach might use this simulated history to better explain how patterns are produced as a result of model structure, and we provide an example of this approach using variations of a simulation model of breeding synchrony in bird colonies. This example illustrates not only why observed patterns are produced in this particular case, but also how generative simulation models function more generally. Aggregated summaries of emergent system-level patterns will remain an important component of modellers' toolkits, but narratives can act as an intermediary between formal descriptions of model structure and these summaries. Using a narrative approach should help generative simulation modellers to better communicate the process by which they learn so that their activities and results can be more widely interpreted. In turn, this will allow non-modellers to foster a fuller appreciation of the function and benefits of generative simulation modelling. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"Graw, Frederik; Leitner, Thomas; Ribeiro, Ruy M.",Agent-based and phylogenetic analyses reveal how HIV-1 moves between risk groups: Injecting drug users sustain the heterosexual epidemic in Latvia,EPIDEMICS,"Injecting drug users (IDUs) are a driving force for the spread of HIV-1 in Latvia and other Baltic States, accounting for a majority of cases. However, in recent years, heterosexual cases have increased disproportionately. It is unclear how the changes in incidence patterns in Latvia can be explained, and how important IDUs are for the heterosexual sub-epidemic. We introduce a novel epidemic model and use phylogenetic analyses in parallel to examine the spread of HIV-1 in Latvia between 1987 and 2010. Using a hybrid framework with a mean-field description for the susceptible population and an agent-based model for the infecteds. we track infected individuals and follow transmission histories dynamically formed during the simulation. The agent-based simulations and the phylogenetic analysis show that more than half of the heterosexual transmissions in Latvia were caused by IDU, which sustain the heterosexual epidemic. Indeed, we find that heterosexual clusters are characterized by short transmission chains with up to 63% of the chains dying out after the first introduction. In the simulations, the distribution of transmission chain sizes follows a power law distribution, which is confirmed by the phylogenetic data. Our models indicate that frequent introductions reduced the extinction probability of an autonomously spreading heterosexual HIV-1 epidemic, which now has the potential to dominate the spread of the overall epidemic in the future. Furthermore, our model shows that social heterogeneity of the susceptible population can explain the shift in HIV-1 incidence in Latvia over the course of the epidemic. Thus, the decrease in IDU incidence may be due to local heterogeneities in transmission, rather than the implementation of control measures. Increases in susceptibles, through social or geographic movement of IDU, could lead to a boost in HIV-1 infections in this risk group. Targeting individuals that bridge social groups would help prevent further spread of the epidemic. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"Martens, Karel; Benenson, Itzhak",Evaluating urban parking policies with agent-based model of driver parking behavior,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD,"This paper presents an explicit agent-based model of parking search in a city. In the model, drivers drive toward their destination, search for parking, park, remain at the parking place, and leave. The city's infrastructure is represented by a high-resolution geographic information system (GIS) of the street network and parking lots; information is included on traffic directions and permitted turns, on-street parking permissions, and layers of off-street parking places and lots. Destinations are presented by layers of dwellings and public places. Driver agents belong to one of four categories: residents and guests with dwellings as destinations and employees and customers with public places as destinations. Each agent has its own destination, willingness to pay, time of arrival, and duration of stay. In the model, driver agents are landed at a distance of approximately 250 m from their destination, that is, close to the area in which drivers start searching for parking. First, a driver estimates the parking situation in the area and then starts to search for a parking place. During the search, a driver agent accounts for the availability of parking places, differences in pricing, and parking enforcement efforts. The model outputs include distributions of (a) search time, (b) distance between parking place and destination, (c) fees paid by the drivers, and (d) parking revenues for the proprietor of paid parking places (whether local authority or private operator).

The complexity arises from an interplay of several factors, as explained by Herbert Simon's model of bounded rationality, the theory of diffusion of innovations through spatial contagion, the role of personal environmental values and local culture, and simple historical momentum. This complexity can be captured using 'artificial life agents' that model land-use choice for individual parcels by considering characteristics and personal beliefs of the owner or operator, physical traits of the land, and information obtained via social networks. Agents are therefore able to consider holistically a large number of factors affecting land-use choice. The creation of agent-based models of human behavior described herein is based upon empirical data on the acceptance of Conservation Reserve Program for the Cache River watershed of southern Illinois (USA). These models are interfaced with a geographic information system to produce a spatial decision support system capable of anticipating the effects of policies that affect land-use decisionmaking on a real landscape and their economic performance.",NOV,2005,32,6,10.1068/b31193,http://dx.doi.org/10.1068/b31193

This model is a completely spatialized approach taking into account a series of often overlooked parameters such as human behaviour (activity-related movements), the density and mobility of the disease vectors - tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) - and the influence of other tsetse feeding hosts (livestock and wild animal populations). The agents that represent humans and tsetse flies move in a spatially structured environment managed by specialized location agents. Existing compartmental mathematical models governed by differential equations fail to incorporate the spatial dimension of the disease transmission. Furthermore, on a small scale, transmission is unrealistically represented by entities less than one. This ABM was tested with data from one village of the Bipindi sleeping sickness focus (southern Cameroon) and with obtained realistic simulations of stable transmission involving an animal reservoir. In varying different spatial Configurations, we observe that the stability of spread is linked to the spatial complexity (number of heterogeneous locations). The prevalence is very sensitive to the human densities and to the number of tsetse flies initially infected in a given location. A relatively low and durable prevalence is obtained with shortening the phase I. In addition, we discuss some upgrading possibilities, in particular the linkage to a Geographical Information System (GIS).

While spatial heterogeneity and individual variation have been considered as noise in the past, this is exactly what has become the centre of interest of the individual-based paradigm in ecology. According to Individual-based Ecology, the interaction and behaviour of individual organisms leads to the emergence of macro-level patterns on the system scale. Although individual-based models have almost always been spatially explicit, the focus was commonly given to temporal processes and behavioural rules over spatial aspects. Today, the wide availability of spatial data and ever increasing computational power together with a strive for realistic models has renewed the attention to spatial aspects in simulation modelling. This review provides an overview of the state of the art of Spatial Simulation modelling in Ecology, reviews its limitations and open issues and it discusses future research avenues by taking an explicit geospatial perspective. The main avenues that are discussed revolve around the role of spatial context to determine the structure of living systems, potentials of hybrid top-down/bottom-up model designs to integrate hierarchical, spatial and temporal scales of ecological systems, and current trends in the representation and analysis of simulated spatio-temporal (big) data.

One source of complexity is the uncertainties involved in the decisions and behaviors of human actors that determine how landholdings are managed. Land management decisions are often influenced by diverse factors and considerations. Particularly significant among these are (1) the sources of information land managers utilize with their perceived quality, reliability, and accessibility; (2) the social networks of the decision maker with their pertinent history, appeal, and authority; and (3) the interests, resources, and prior experiences of individual decision makers. This degree of diversity and uncertainty gives rise to behaviors that cannot be entirely explained in terms of rational choice or any variation thereof. How can we best understand and explain these behaviors, as spatial but also social and informational, in land-use decision making? This article presents the case of land management in a county in the Midwest United States to develop a conceptual model of decision making of environmental resources in socio-ecological systems.

"Schwoon, Malte",A tool to optimize the initial distribution of hydrogen filling stations,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT,"An important barrier towards the introduction of fuel cell vehicles running on hydrogen is the lack of widespread refueling infrastructure. The niche of buses for public transport, taxis and deliverers with a local application area might not be large enough to generate the reductions of fuel cell vehicle costs that are necessary for a general technology switch. Thus, fuel availability at trunk roads probably plays a crucial role in generating demand for these also from private consumers. In this paper, we assume that consumers are more likely to consider buying a fuel cell vehicle the more frequently they are exposed to hydrogen refueling opportunities on long distant trips. We introduce a tool to test different small-scale initial distributions of hydrogen outlets within the German trunk road system for their potential success to generate a large-scale adoption of fuel cell vehicles. The tool makes use of agent-based trip modeling and geographic information system supported spatial modeling. We demonstrate its potentials by testing a ring shaped distribution of hydrogen outlets at highway filling stations.

"Topping, Chris J.; Dalby, Lars; Skov, Flemming",Landscape structure and management alter the outcome of a pesticide ERA: Evaluating impacts of endocrine disruption using the ALMaSS European Brown Hare model,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"There is a gradual change towards explicitly considering landscapes in regulatory risk assessment. To realise the objective of developing representative scenarios for risk assessment it is necessary to know how detailed a landscape representation is needed to generate a realistic risk assessment, and indeed how to generate such landscapes. This paper evaluates the contribution of landscape and farming components to a model based risk assessment of a fictitious endocrine disruptor on hares. In addition, we present methods and code examples for generation of landscape structures and farming simulation from data collected primarily for EU agricultural subsidy support and GIS map data. Ten different Danish landscapes were generated and the ERA carried out for each landscape using two different assumed toxicities. The results showed negative impacts in all cases, but the extent and formin terms of impacts on abundance or occupancy differed greatly between landscapes. A meta-model was created, predicting impact from landscape and farming characteristics. Scenarios based on all combinations of farming and landscape for five landscapes representing extreme and middle impacts were created. The meta-models developed from the 10 real landscapes failed to predict impacts for these 25 scenarios. Landscape, farming, and the emergent density of hares all influenced the results of the risk assessment considerably. The study indicates that prediction of a reasonable worst case scenario is difficult from structural, farming or population metrics; rather the emergent properties generated from interactions between landscape, management and ecology are needed. Meta-modelling may also fail to predict impacts, even when restricting inputs to combinations of those used to create the model. Future ERA may therefore need to make use of multiple scenarios representing a wide range of conditions to avoid locally unacceptable risks. This approach could now be feasible Europe wide given the landscape generation methods presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To model at these fine spatial scales, and to better account for the dynamics of the crime system, agent-based models of crime are emerging. Generally, these have been more successful in representing the behaviour of criminals than their victims. In this paper it is suggested that individual representations of criminal behaviour can be enhanced by combining them with models of the criminal environment which are specified at a similar scale. In the case of burglary this means the identification of individual households as targets. We will show how this can be achieved using the complementary technique of microsimulation. The work is significant because it allows agent-based models of crime to be refined geographically (to allow, for example, individual households with varying wealth or occupancy measures) and leads to the identification of the characteristics of individual victims.

Through IS, companies can use wastes produced by other companies as inputs to production processes. Online platforms supporting companies in operating IS relationships can play a critical role in developing the IS practice. In this paper, an agent-based model is designed to simulate the emergence of IS relationships among companies located in a given geographical area. Companies can establish relationships traditionally (relying on faceto-face contacts) or by using a platform. Several scenarios, defined by different platform usage rates, are simulated. Results show that there is a minimum platform usage rate allowing companies to benefit from using the platform. If the platform usage rate is lower than this threshold, the platform does not contribute to generate further benefits for companies. When the platform usage rate is higher than the threshold, the individual benefits for users are higher the greater the number of other companies using the platform.

In such a network, the global environmental strain is no longer equal to the sum of the environmental strain of the individual actors, but it is dependent on how well the network performs as a whole. The development of methods to understand, manage or optimize such networks remains an open issue. In this paper we put forward a simulation model of by-product flow between industrial actors. The goal is to introduce a method for modelling symbiotic exchanges from a macro perspective. The model takes into account the effect of two main mechanisms on a multi-objective optimization of symbiotic processes. First it allows us to study the effect of geographical properties of the economic system, said differently, where actors are divided in space. Second, it allows us to study the effect of clustering complementary actors together as a function of distance, by means of a spatial correlation between the actors' by-products. Our simulations unveil patterns that are relevant for macro-level policy. First, our results show that the geographical properties are an important factor for the macro performance of symbiotic processes. Second, spatial correlations, which can be interpreted as planned clusters such as Eco-industrial parks, can lead to a very effective macro performance, but only if these are strictly implemented. Finally, we provide a proof of concept by comparing the model to real world data from the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register database using georeferencing of the companies in the dataset.

Up until now, current assessments rely on analytical models. Most of these models average distances for barges and trains via route mapping platforms that provide realistic distances for road only. To reflect on real-world developments more accurately, new thinking and modelling approaches are necessary to bridge academic models with physical transport processes. This paper introduces a computational model which computes movements of agents in geographically referenced space. The model captures stochastic parallel processes for each mode, and simulates decentralized delivery performance of each order in terms of cost, time and emissions at an operational level. Furthermore, we study the routing of individual orders and their responsiveness to disruptions. Computational experiments are performed within a case study which concerns imports of retail goods by unimodal truck transport from France to Belgium.

The model aims to produce statistical data on mosquito behaviours and population dynamics that are difficult to obtain through field surveys such as population densities in various geographical and climatic conditions. It can also be used to explore effects of vector control strategies on population dynamics. The model simulates adult mosquitoes as 'agents' which interact with their local environment. The latter provides resources for their biological development and can also constrain their flight or egg-laying behaviours. Variations in environmental configurations such as land-use and climate make it possible to explore the dependence of mosquito population dynamics on the context. This paper gives a detailed description of the model's various components and the overall approach used to calibrate and validate it. Study of simulated mosquito behaviours reveals the model's ability to produce the mosquito's realistic life cycle. The mosquito cohort's flight distance in various urban landscapes is also explored.

Public health strategies to deliver services in community-based settings are key to enhancing the utilization of preventive care and reducing costs for this segment of the population. Motivated by concerns of inadequate access to oral health care by older adults in urban environments, this article presents a portfolio of systems science models that have been developed on the basis of observations from the ElderSmile preventive screening program operated in northern Manhattan, New York City, by the Columbia University College of Dental Medicine. Using the methodology of system dynamics, models are developed to explore how interpersonal relationships influence older adults' participation in oral health promotion. Feedback mechanisms involving word of mouth about preventive screening opportunities are represented in relation to stocks that change continuously via flows, as well as agents whose states of health care utilization change discretely using stochastic transitions. Agent-based implementations illustrate how social networks and geographic information systems are integrated into dynamic models to reflect heterogeneous and proximity-based patterns of communication and participation in the ElderSmile program. The systems science approach builds shared knowledge among an interdisciplinary research team about the dynamics of access to opportunities for oral health promotion.

Existing models however cannot be readily integrated in agent-based models that assume random-utility-maximizing behavior of agents. We propose an agent-based model to generate social networks explicitly in geographic space which is formulated in the random-utility-maximizing (RUM) framework. The proposed model consists of a friendship formation mechanism and a component to simulate social encounters in a population. We show how transitivity can be incorporated in both components and how the model can be estimated based on data of personal networks using likelihood estimation. In an application to the Swiss context, we demonstrate the estimation and ability of the model to reproduce relevant characteristics of networks, such as geographic proximity, attribute similarity (homophily), size of personal networks (degree distribution) and clustering (transitivity).

While detention basins are considered one of the main GI strategies, their benefits cannot be fully realized without properly maintaining them and making sure that they stay operational. Therefore, this paper used agent-based modeling (ABM) to devise an optimal main-tenance program for detention basins to ensure that they function properly and continue to perform their water quality and flood control functions. More specifically, the following 2 agent types were incorporated in the model: 1) the detention basins were considered as static agents, and 2) the service teams responsible for the operation (maintenance, repair, and replacement) of the detention basins were considered as active agents. The developed ABM was applied for the entire network of stormwater detention basins in Newark, NJ. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the most critical variables affecting the total cost of operating the network of detention basins as well as the functioning percentage of detention basins. In addition, optimization was implemented to determine the best maintenance program or policy that minimizes the total cost of operations, while also making sure that a desired functionality level or threshold is achieved for the entire network of detention basins. Finally, the ABM was statistically validated using a total of 10,000 Monte Carlo runs and 99% confidence intervals. The optimization results showed that, in order to minimize the total cost of maintaining the entire network of detention basins and ensure that at least 80% of the basins are in a functioning state at the end of the planning horizon, the decision-maker should implement the following maintenance program or strategy: have 2 service teams for the operations of the detention basins, follow a replacement policy, and replace detention basins after 3 maintenance periods. Also, the identified optimal maintenance program or strategy would result with an average total annual cost of around $4,085,000, where the average annual repair cost is around $2,572,200, the average annual maintenance cost is around $19,700, the average annual replacement cost is around $763,100, and the average annual service team cost is around $730,000.

This paucity in representative detail can dilute the usefulness of ABMs when details are important in exploring what-if dimensions of the phenomena being considered, because abstraction can limit the range of questions that can be asked of a model. This is true, in particular, in multi-hazard earthquake models, where agents are now commonly used for representing humans, but often lack sufficient detail to reconcile them with other parts of the chained modeling pipeline. Increasing the spatial and temporal detail of these models is challenging, for a number of reasons, not least of which is the requirement that realistic process models must be developed for many objects, across many domains.

Increased turbidity and reduced benthic light availability for eelgrass occur when bedload transport of macroalgae erode surface sediment. Furthermore, drifting macroalgae ballistically damage eelgrass beds and increase seedling mortality. The frequency and impact of drifting macroalgae in Odense Fjord was evaluated with an agent-based model. The aims of this model were to understand and predict the mobility of opportunistic (Chaetomorpha linum) and non-ephemeral (Fucus vesiculosus) macroalgae and to describe and quantify the intensity and spatial distribution of bottom substrate physically affected by drifting macroalgae. The longest simulated movement by macroalgae was found to be 270 and 170 km for brown and green algae respectively; while the macroalgae losses (export) out of the fjord were up to 11% of the total biomass; the simulated area impacted by macroalgae drift varied between 16% and 96.5% of the total ford area; finally the degree on physically impacted area varied from 0.01 to 28.5 m of algae track m(-2). The simulated pattern of drift distribution and hot spots for both brown and green algae fitted the geographical locations in which the algae community was observed on the field.

Using agent-based modelling to improve battlefield excavations,JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE,"The study of material culture generated by military engagements has created an emergent sub-discipline of archaeological studies centred on battlefields. This approach has developed a particular and sophisticated methodology that is able to deal with the fact that archaeologists will often not find either structures or a useful stratigraphical record on the site, as the material remains of the battle will basically be metallic objects carried by combatants. It is therefore rather complicated not only to test hypotheses about battle events based on archaeological data, but also to validate the methodology used. Here we propose the use of agent-based models to explore these issues in the case of eighteenth-century battlefield archaeology. The simulation is divided into four different steps. Firstly, a battle is simulated in order to generate realistic virtual archaeological remains left by an engagement between two armies of this era. We then simulate the loss of information that the passing of time produces in the battlefield. The third step involves simulating the archaeological survey, enabling us to explore different survey strategies and the impact on the interpretation of the event itself. Finally, we design a confidence index in order to compare the results of the different virtual excavations using spatial analysis and statistics. The results show that the methodology is fully functional in terms of understanding a battle, and it allows us to suggest new strategies to improve fieldwork and to develop new ways of exploring these particular archaeological sites. It is concluded that the described approach illustrates how simulation can be used to explore methodological issues of archaeological science. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In British Columbia, this forest insect disturbance has resulted in losses of more than 13 million hectares of pine trees. The complexity of the MPB emergence, aggregation and attack behaviour is captured by this study, using an intelligent agent-based model (ABM) of beetle outbreaks at a local scale of individual trees. Agent-based approach permits simulation of interactions that describe the ecological context in which insect populations spread. Intelligent reasoning is introduced by a swarm intelligence (SI) algorithm integrated with the ABM that depicts indirect communication, collective behaviour and self-organized aggregation of insects in a forest ecosystem. The objectives of this study are the following: 1) to develop ForestSimMPB model that integrates SI and ABM within a geographic information systems (GIS) framework; 2) to implement the proposed model on real datasets to simulate the MPB aggregation and mass attacks on lodgepole pine trees; and 3) to determine the spatial patterns and extents of these attacks. The ForestSimMPB is calibrated by fine tuning two model parameters, and implemented using data from three sites located in the Cariboo Regional District in the central interior of BC. The obtained results demonstrate the aggregation behaviour of MPB to collectively attack lodgepole pines, as well as portray the spatial clustering of dead trees resulting from infestation. Simulation outputs provide analysis and predictions of spatial patterns in the forest landscape structure as a result of a MPB outbreak.

The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively evaluate the environmental impact of city-scale DWM from a complex system perspective.

Based on an empirical analysis of Shenzhen, China, it is found that the environmental impact of city-scale DWM is mainly concentrated in the central and northeastern regions of Shenzhen, demonstrating spatial heterogeneity and regional aggregation. Furthermore, the results reveal that the model is robust and effective to assess environmental impact from four aspects, i.e., land occupation, water pollution, air pollution and energy consumption.

This study models the effects of social influence on household evacuation behavior in anticipation of a hurricane event. An agent-based model was developed in this study to simulate: 1) a home workplace social network between households residing in the Florida Keys, 2) the communication of a hurricane evacuation order among socially linked households, and 3) the resulting spatio-temporal diffusion of household evacuation behavior. Data sources informing model implementation include U.S. Census block group data, business databases, and statistics from hurricane evacuation surveys. Simulated model results from the model were validated with empirical traffic records observed at a Florida Keys monitoring station during evacuation from Hurricane Georges in 1998. This model builds upon previous research using agent-based models to simulate hurricane evacuation by incorporating multiple data sources and validating results with empirical traffic patterns. Such an empirically-grounded model facilitates locally relevant exploration of evacuation behavior to support the development of more effective evacuation plans and preparedness for future hurricane events.",MAR,2019,74,,10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.11.010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.11.010

However, evacuation routes may be hindered by building debris and vehicles, thus leading to longer evacuation times and an increased risk of loss of life. Herein, we apply an agent-based model to study the evacuation situation of the coastal city of Iquique, north Chile, where most of the population is exposed to inundation from an incoming tsunami. The study evaluates different earthquake scenarios characterized by different ground motion intensities in terms of the evacuation process within a predefined inundation zone. Evacuating agents consider the microscale interactions with cars and other people using a collision avoidance algorithm. Results for the no ground shaking scenario are compared for validation with those of a real evacuation drill done in 2013 for the entire city.

The integration of parallel SE-ABM with CyberGIS could facilitate straightforward access to massive computational resources and geographic information systems to support pre- and post-simulation analysis and visualization. However, to benefit from CyberGIS integration, parallel SE-ABM must overcome the challenge of communication management for orchestrating many processor cores in parallel computing environments. This paper examines and addresses this challenge by describing a generic framework for the management of inter-processor communication to enable parallel SE-ABM to scale to high-performance parallel computers. The framework synthesizes four interrelated components: agent grouping, rectilinear domain decomposition, a communication-aware load-balancing strategy, and entity proxies. The results of a series of computational experiments based on a template agent-based model demonstrate that parallel computational efficiency diminishes as inter-processor communication increases, particularly when scaling a fixed-size model to thousands of processor cores. Therefore, effective communication management is crucial. The communication framework is shown to efficiently scale up to 2048 cores, demonstrating its ability to effectively scale to thousands of processor cores to support the simulation of billions of agents. In a simulated scenario, the communication-aware load-balancer reduced both overall simulation time and communication percentage improving overall computational efficiency.

Agent-based models that integrate geographical environments to generate crime patterns have emerged in recent years, although data-driven crime simulations are scarce. This article (1) identifies numerous important drivers of crime patterns, (2) collects relevant, openly available data sources to build a GIS-layer with static and dynamic geographical, as well as temporal features relevant to crime, (3) builds a virtual urban environment with these layers, in which individual offender agents navigate, (4) proposes a data-driven decision-making process using machine-learning for the agents to decide whether to engage in criminal activity based on their perception of the environment and, finally, (5) generates fine-grained crime patterns in a simulated urban environment. The novelty of this work lies in the various large-scale data layers, the integration of machine learning at individual agent level to process the data layers, and the high resolution of the resulting predictions. The results show that the spatial, temporal, and interaction layers are all required to predict the top street segments with the highest number of crimes. In addition, the spatial layer is the most informative, which means that spatial data contributes most to predictive performance.

Here we use an agent-based model to explore a specific opportunities-parasites trade-off (OPTO) hypothesis, according to which utility-maximizing agents place themselves at an optimal point on a trade-off between (a) the gains that may be achieved through accessing the resources of geographically or socially distant out-group members through openness to out-group interaction, and (b) the losses arising due to consequently increased risks of exotic infection to which immunity has not been developed. We examine the evolution of cooperation and the formation of social groups within social networks, and we show that the groups that spontaneously form exhibit greater local rather than global cooperative networks when levels of infection are high.

To confront these problems, environmental managers must consider human and landscape systems in integrated ways. This means making use of data obtained from a broad range of methods (e.g., sensors, surveys), while taking into account new findings from the social and biophysical science literatures. New integrative methods (including data fusion, simulation modeling, and participatory approaches) have emerged in recent years to address these challenges, and to allow analysts to provide information that links qualitative and quantitative elements for policymakers. This paper brings attention to these emergent tools while providing an overview of the tools currently in use for analysis of human-landscape interactions. Analysts are now faced with a staggering array of approaches in the human-landscape literature-in an attempt to bring increased clarity to the field, we identify the relative strengths of each tool, and provide guidance to analysts on the areas to which each tool is best applied. We discuss four broad categories of tools: statistical methods (including survival analysis, multi-level modeling, and Bayesian approaches), GIS and spatial analysis methods, simulation approaches (including cellular automata, agent-based modeling, and participatory modeling), and mixed-method techniques (such as alternative futures modeling and integrated assessment). For each tool, we offer an example from the literature of its application in human-landscape research.

J.",Models in geography revisited,GEOFORUM,"Agent based models (ABMs) have many applications, and illustrate a rapidly developing field of enquiry, spanning both the physical-mathematical and human-social sciences. ABMs are seen as most appropriate in situations where decisions or actions are distributed around particular locations, and in which structure is viewed as emergent from the interaction between individuals. ABMs may be used either as representational devices, to reproduce the patterns observed or desired in the system of interest, or as foundational tools contributing to the development of social or economic theory. The role and status of models and modelling is itself an instantiation of a wider debate concerning representation and explanation. Today, a case can be made that the nature of explanation and the use of scientific interpretation reflect much less definite and exclusive positions and permit more diverse approaches than hitherto. The underlying proposition of this commentary is, therefore, that the time is right for a positive application of ABMs within the discipline of geography, and for a rediscovery and reappraisal of the richness and depth of insight in the model-building enterprise more generally. First, the context for ABM development and application is set with reference to the agency-structure debate. Second, some aspects of the heritage of models in geography is presented, based upon reviews of two benchmark publications bearing that title.

This study establishes an integrated framework to determine the optimal locations for TDMSs that meet geographic requirements while minimizing the social and economic impacts imposed on the community due to uncollected debris. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to locate candidate TDMSs based on geographic parameters set forth by governing agencies. To consider the subsequent impact of TDMSs on debris collection, an agent-based model was constructed to evaluate post-disaster debris removal performance with varying TDMSs planning scenarios. Using the AnyLogic Optimization engine, the selection of TDMSs locations was optimized to minimize both overall debris collection time and subsequent negative impacts of uncollected debris on the public. The validity of the proposed framework was demonstrated through its application for determining optimal TDMSs locations in Liberty County, Florida, in response to Hurricane Michael where vegetative debris (i.e., potential fire hazards) and the debris within the urban areas are prioritized for collection. Compared to the actual debris collection time, the selected near-optimal TDMS locations resulted in a decrease in the total debris collection time from 156 to 112 days, with vegetative debris and debris located within the urban areas being collected within 60 and 70 days, respectively.

When the number of attributes describing the agents and/or their level of detail becomes large, survey data cannot densely support the joint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of dimensionality. It leads to a situation where many attribute combinations are missing from the sample data while such combinations exist in the real population. In this case, it becomes essential to consider methods that are able to impute such missing information effectively. In this paper, we propose to use deep generative latent models. These models are able to learn a compressed representation of the data space, which when projected back to the original space, leads to an effective way of imputing information in the observed data space. Specifically, we employ the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) and the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for a large-scale population synthesis application. The models are applied to a Danish travel survey with a feature-space of more than 60 variables and trained and tested using cross validation. A new metric that applies to the evaluation of generative models in an unsupervised setting is proposed. It is based on the ability to generate diverse yet valid synthetic attribute combinations by comparing if the models can recover missing combinations (sampling zeros) while keeping truly impossible combinations (structural zeros) models at a minimum. For a low dimensional experiment, the VAE, the marginal sampler and the fully random sampler generate 5%, 21% and 26% more structural zeros per sampling zero when compared to the WGAN. For a high dimensional case, these figures increase to 44%, 2217% and 170440% respectively.

In many emergency scenarios, mass evacuation is necessary to cope with severe public threats within tight spatiotemporal ranges. To better understand complex phenomena like mass evacuation, and study possible consequences, agent-based models (ABMs) have been widely developed in previous work. Existing models simulate individual behaviors, posing computational challenges when applied to large geographic areas and sophisticated behaviors. A key strategy for resolving such computational challenges is to partition transportation networks into smaller regions and resolve corresponding computational costs by taking advantage of advanced cyberinfrastructure and cyberGIS. In this study, a novel network partition algorithm is developed to improve the scalability of agent-based modeling of mass evacuation based on a cutting-edge cyberGIS-enabled computational framework that exploits the spatial movement patterns of emergency evacuation. Specifically, the algorithm is termed as Voronoi Clustering based on Target-Shift, or ViCTS. It is enlightened by network Voronoi diagrams and designed to resolve computational scalability challenges caused by the unique characteristics of evacuation traffic. We conducted a set of computational experiments with real street network data in various evacuation scenarios to test the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm.

Because earthquakes can be one of the most disastrous events, especially in Iran, the purpose of this article is to develop an easy-to-use multi-agent simulation and modeling environment for the assessment of different disaster management scenarios as measured in terms of saving additional lives. The earthquake-induced damages to buildings, streets and citizens are the inputs to the proposed model. Five mobile agent types: citizen, paramedic, street-opener, police and robber; one stationary agent type: gas valve; and five inactive agent types: building, street, shelter, hospital and fire station form the context of the model. Disaster managers are provided with customizable settings for the number and attributes of the agents in the user interface and can assess various statistical and visual results to determine the optimal number and characteristics of the agents as well as evaluate the effectiveness of the location of shelters. To simulate the extent of a calamity, this model is tested on a small region in Tehran, Iran. The agents are created and input to the model automatically via vector GIS data layers and the entire model is vector-based. A comparison between the results of two different scenarios highlights that increasing the number of street-openers and paramedics would not create the desired improvement as long as these agents are focused on fire stations and hospitals.

"Torrens, Paul M.; McDaniel, Aaron W.",Modeling Geographic Behavior in Riotous Crowds,ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS,"Under some conditions, tensions among crowd members, harbored a priori or developed on site, might catalyze a crowd to riot, with dramatic consequences. We know perhaps less than we would like to about the processes that drive rioting in crowds because they are difficult to study. In particular, we know relatively little about the influence of geographic behavior on rioting, although there exists a general sense that it is important. In lieu of pragmatic avenues for studying riots, we could use simulation as a synthetic laboratory for exploration. To be useful, simulations must be based on realistic behavioral models, but the extant science for riot modeling has not traditionally provided that support. In this article, we introduce a new approach to modeling riot-prone and riotous crowds using behavior-driven computational agents. We demonstrate a simulation architecture based on socioemotional agents, modeled at atomic levels and characteristic times for riot activity, but extended with the use of geographical functionality that endows agents with spatial perception, cognition, and action that helps to determine where, when, how, and in what contexts and company their agency should be deployed and interpreted. In essence, our agents are polyspatial, with the ability to adapt their behavioral geography under shifting circumstances and to differentially process geographic information from diverse sources. We illustrate the usefulness of this scheme through simulation of a varying set of scenarios for riot formation, evolution, and dissolution, as well as in exploring the interplay among different characteristics, traits, and goals of riot participants.",,2013,103,1,10.1080/00045608.2012.685047,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00045608.2012.685047
"Li, Xia",Emergence of bottom-up models as a tool for landscape simulation and planning,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,"Geographical Information Systems (GIS) adopt a top-town approach which may have limitations for solving many landscape simulation and planning problems. Recently, a number of bottom-up models, such as cellular automaton models (CAs), agent-based models (ABMs), and swarm intelligence models (SIMs), have emerged as an important tool for assisting complex decision-making processes associated with landscape changes. These bottom-up models can be combined together and integrated with GIS to produce better modeling effects. This paper discuses the potentials and challenges for using these models.

Nevertheless, many past resilience assessments have been theoretical and have failed to address the requirements of practitioners. Assessment methods can also be subjective, relying on opinion-based judgements, and can lack empirical validation. Scope exists to address these challenges through drawing on rapidly emerging sources of data and smart analytics. This, alongside the careful selection of the metrics used in assessment of resilience, can facilitate more robust assessment methods. This work sets out to establish a set of core metrics, and data sources suitable for inclusion within a data-driven coastal resilience assessment. A case study region of East Anglia, UK, is focused on, and data types and sources associated with a set of proven assessment metrics were identified. Virtually all risk-specific metrics could be satisfied using available or derived data sources. However, a high percentage of the resilience-specific metrics would still require human input. This indicates that assessment of resilience is inherently more subjective than assessment of risk. Yet resilience assessments incorporate both risk and resilience specific variables. As such it was possible to link 75% of our selected metrics to empirical sources. Through taking a case study approach and discussing a set of requirements outlined by a coastal authority, this paper reveals scope for the incorporation of rapidly progressing data collection, dissemination, and analytical methods, within dynamic coastal resilience assessments.

HCV prevalence is influenced by a complex interplay of drug-use behaviors, social networks, and geography, as well as the availability of interventions, such as needle exchange programs. To adequately address this complexity in HCV epidemic forecasting, we have developed a computational model, the Agent-based Pathogen Kinetics model (APK). APK simulates the PWID population in metropolitan Chicago, including the social interactions that result in HCV infection. We used multiple empirical data sources on Chicago PWID to build a spatial distribution of an in silico PWID population and modeled networks among the PWID by considering the geography of the city and its suburbs. APK was validated against 2012 empirical data (the latest available) and shown to agree with network and epidemiological surveys to within 1%. For the period 2010-2020, APK forecasts a decline in HCV prevalence of 0.8% per year from 44(+/- 2)% to 36(+/- 5)%, although some sub-populations would continue to have relatively high prevalence, including Non-Hispanic Blacks, 48(+/- 5)%. The rate of decline will be lowest in Non-Hispanic Whites and we find, in a reversal of historical trends, that incidence among non-Hispanic Whites would exceed incidence among Non-Hispanic Blacks (0.66 per 100 per years vs 0.17 per 100 person years). APK also forecasts an increase in PWID mean age from 35(+/- 1) to 40(+/- 2) with a corresponding increase from 59 (+/- 2)% to 80(+/- 6)% in the proportion of the population >30 years old. Our studies highlight the importance of analyzing subpopulations in disease predictions, the utility of computer simulation for analyzing demographic and health trends among PWID and serve as a tool for guiding intervention and prevention strategies in Chicago, and other major cities.",30-Sep,2015,10,9,10.1371/journal.pone.0137993,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0137993

In order to validate these models a large amount of computing is necessary for their simulation and calibration. Here a new data-processing chain, including an automated calibration procedure, is tested on a computational grid using evolutionary algorithms. This is applied for the first time to a geographical model designed to simulate the evolution of an early urban settlement system. The method enables us to reduce the computing time and provides robust results. Using this method, we identify several parameter settings that minimize three objective functions that quantify how closely the model results match a reference pattern. As the values of each parameter in different settings are very close, this estimation considerably reduces the initial possible domain of variation of the parameters.

These methods are now being used in geophysics, ecology, zoology, and increasingly in the social sciences. A characteristic is that the agents are embedded in an environment with which they interact, so that joint evolution of physical, ecological and socio-economic systems can be studied; this makes them of interest in integrated geographical investigation. Of particular interest is the fact that they allow the study of macro-scale emergent behaviour generated by multiple individual actions. Discrete techniques have the potential to create integrated models that cross disciplines. Similar computational methods can be employed to control the spatial search process, deal with irregular or changing boundaries, and to track the evolution of systems where preservation of heterogeneity across space and time is important. The complex series of feedbacks between the different types of system can thus be modelled within a single computational framework. Humans modelled in this way as agents can allow the collective effect of many interacting individuals to generate emergent structures at the community scale. The structural characteristics of their social and natural environments will influence their behaviour, while at the same time constituting emergent consequences of their actions. The principal challenge of the latter is to find those sets of rules that represent the beliefs and desires of real human agents, accurately reflecting the cultural context, while allowing us to explore the social and economic limitations of agents to take action. This paper reviews and illustrates discrete methods applicable to a range of geographical enquiries, and with particular reference to individual- and agent-based methods, assesses the rich diversity of approaches that must be combined to take full advantage of their potential to explore interactions of social and environmental processes.

Discussion of issues such as the complexity of reporting and the need for standard procedures and terms becomes more critical as repositories bring together research materials, including entire models, from various sources. Efforts to mitigate many of modeling's challenges have involved phase-specific modeling and use of such methods as expressions or uncertainty analysis in place of a complex secondary model.

Besides forming a geographical barrier, mountains have a profound impact on the resulting wind flow. We use a novel framework of mathematical models to investigate the influences of wind and topography on nocturnal passerine bird behaviour, and to assess the energy costs for different flight strategies for crossing the Jura Mountains. The mathematical models include three biological models of bird behaviour: i) wind drift compensation; ii) adaptation of flight height for favourable winds; and, iii) avoidance of obstacles (cross over and/or circumvention of an obstacle following a minimum energy expenditure strategy), which are assessed separately and in combination. Further, we use a mesoscale weather model for high-resolution predictions of the wind fields. We simulate the broad front nocturnal passerine migration for autumn nights with peak migration intensities. The bird densities retrieved from a weather radar are used as the initial intensities and to specify the vertical distributions of the simulated birds. It is shown that migration over complex terrain represents the most expensive flight option in terms of energy expenditure, and wind is seen to be the main factor that influences the energy expenditure in the bird's preferred flight direction. Further, the combined effects of wind and orography lead to a high concentration of migratory birds within the favourable wind conditions of the Swiss lowlands and north of the Jura Mountains.

M.; Bar-Yam, Yaneer",Conditions for neutral speciation via isolation by distance,JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY,"The branching of new species from an ancestral population requires the evolution of reproductive isolation between groups of individuals. Geographic separation of sub-populations by natural barriers, if sustained for sufficiently long times, may lead to the accumulation of independent genetic changes in each group and to mating incompatibilities (Mayr, 2001; Fitzpatrick et al., 2009). A similar phenomenon may occur in the absence of barriers via isolation by distance if the population is distributed over large areas (de Aguiar et al., 2009; Etienne and Haegeman, 2011; Gavrilets et al., 2000). The first demonstration of this process was based on computer simulations employing agent-based models. Recently, analytical results were derived combining network theory, to model the spatial structure of the population, and an ansatz that accounts for the effect of forbidding mating between individuals that are too different genetically (de Aguiar and Bar-Yam, 2011). The main result obtained with this approach is an expression that indicates when speciation is possible as a function of the parameters describing the population. The aim of this work is to test this analytical result by comparing it with numerical simulations for a hermaphroditic population (de Aguiar et al., 2009) and for a population whose individuals are explicitly separated into males and females (Baptestini et al., 2013).

To test this assumption, we compare models made of systems of differential equations (Allen's model firmly rooted in self-organisation theory and the model developed by Weidlich and Haag, affiliated to synergetic theory) with multi-agent models (SIMPOP family) designed to meet the same task: simulating the differentiated dynamics of urban entities over the medium to long term from their functional economic specialisation.

As a class of bottom-up method, ABMs are capable of simulating the decision-making as well as the multiple interactions of autonomous agents and between agents and the environment. The definition of agents' behaviour is a vital issue in implementing ABMs to simulate urban dynamics. Urban economic theory has provided effective ways to cope with this problem. This theory argues that the formation of urban spatial structure is an endogenous process resulting from the interactions among individual actors that are spatially distributed. However, this theory is used to explain urban phenomena regardless of spatial heterogeneity in most cases. This study combines GIS, ABM and urban economic models to simulate complex urban residential dynamics. The time-extended model is incorporated into an ABM so as to define agents' behaviour on a solid theoretical basis. A spatial variable is defined to address the neighbourhood effect by considering spatial heterogeneity. The proposed model is first verified by the simulation of three scenarios using hypothetical data: (1) single dominated preference; (2) varying preferences on the basis of income level; and (3) spatially heterogeneous environment.

To gain insight into this issue, in this article we present a service-oriented simulation framework that supports spatially explicit agent-based modeling within a CI environment. This framework is designed at three levels: intermodel, intrasimulation, and individual. Functionalities at these levels are encapsulated into services, each of which is an assembly of new or existing services. Services at the intermodel and intrasimulation levels are suitable for generic ABM; individual-level services are designed specifically for modeling intelligent agents.

Terrorist networks are the most prominent instantiation of dark networks, and they are alive and well. Attempts to preemptively disrupt these networks and their activities have met with both success and failure. In this paper, we examine the impacts of four common strategies for dismantling terrorist networks. The four strategies are: leader-focused, grassroots, geographic, and random. Each of these strategies has associated pros and cons, and each has different impacts on the structure and capabilities of a terrorist network. Employing a computational experimentation methodology, we simulate a terrorist network and test the effects of each strategy on the resiliency of that network. In addition, we test scenarios in which the terrorist network has (or does not have) information about an impending attack. Our work takes a structural perspective to the challenge of addressing terrorist networks. Specifically, we show how various strategies impact the structure of the network in terms of its resiliency and capacity to carry out future attacks.

This context-driven approach is characterized by the identification of primitive contextual elements, the organization of such elements into context patterns, and contextualized learning. We synthesize two existing frameworks for the representation of spatiotemporal context and extend them to include higher level constructs and feedback mechanisms needed for learning and adaptation. Contextualized information is organized, analyzed, and used by agents to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. Dynamically changing information relevant to the decision-making processes of agents is captured in this approach and used to drive spatiotemporal learning in agents. We examine the utility of this context-driven approach via an agent-based model of elk movement. Elk in this model are represented as contextually aware intelligent agents that learn optimal movement patterns and adapt to heterogeneous landscape dynamics. The internal and external stimuli received by elk during migration are incorporated into the representation of agent context.

In order to meet these challenges, we provide a new Agent based Model, called SiFlo.

These responses are, in part, modulated by political relationships under cultural norms that dominate the institutional and collective decisions of public and private actors. The legacy of these decisions, which are often associated with investment in hard and soft infrastructure, has lasting consequences that influence current and future vulnerabilities. Making those decisions visible, and tractable is, therefore, an urgent research and political challenge in vulnerability assessments. In this work, we present a modeling framework to explore scenarios of institutional decision-making and socio-political processes and the resultant effects on spatial patterns of vulnerability. The approach entails using multi-criteria decision analysis, agent-based models, and geographic information simulation. The approach allows for the exploration of uncertainties, spatial patterns, thresholds, and the sensitivities of vulnerability outcomes to different policy scenarios. Here, we present the operationalization of the framework through an intentionally simplified model example of the governance of water in Mexico City.

While most existing algorithms rely on a sample dataset, the fact that this algorithm does not rely on one makes it a novel contribution. It has potentially widespread application for situations in which such survey data is not available. In contrast to existing sample-free algorithms, the population synthesis presented in this paper applies the heuristics to part of the allocation of synthetic individuals into synthetic households. As a result the iterative process which does this and which is normally the most computationally demanding and time consuming process, is required only for a subset of synthetic individuals. This means that the population synthesiser in this work is computationally efficient enough for practical application to build a large synthetic population (many millions) for many thousands target areas at the smallest possible geographical level. This capability ensures that the geographical heterogeneity of the resulting synthetic population is preserved. The paper presents the application of the newmethod to synthesise the population for New South Wales in Australia in 2006. The resulting total synthetic population has approximately 6 million people living in over 2.3 million households residing in private dwellings across over 11,000 census collection districts (CCDs). Analyses show evidence that the synthetic population matches very well with the census data across seven demographic attributes that characterise the population at both household level and individual level.

Evacuation management of emergency situations is often based on delineation of evacuation circumstances and spatial analyses of the datasets. A practical evacuation management system would be a system that provides an easy configuration to evacuation managers who may not have full knowledge of spatial analysis functionality of geographic information system (GIS) software but need to understand the emergency situation promptly and provide decisive instructions which can be fulfilled when they manage the datasets and develop new workflows in various scenarios. An agent-based simulation approach is capable of demonstrating the spatio-temporal aspect of complex dynamic systems. Spatial analysis toolkits embedded in GIS software and open-source software are utilised in order to demonstrate the feasibility of enabling users to manage spatial data and customise the spatial analysis by combining common data analysis tools to meet their requirements in evacuation planning from both spatial and temporal perspectives. This paper proposes a shelter assignment and routing strategy for evacuating households at the 2011 Brisbane flood event as a scenario-based case study. The result shows that communities located in the east and west of Brisbane are scarcely covered by existing shelters. Furthermore, an agent-based simulation for households located in the service areas of three shelters indicates that the corresponding clearance time is 50 minutes.

The spread of CL is highly associated with the socio-ecological interactions of vectors, hosts and the environment. The heterogeneity of these interactions has hindered CL modeling for healthcare preventive measures in endemic areas. In this study, an agent-based model (ABM) is developed to simulate the dynamics of CL spread based on a Geographic Automata System (GAS). A Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) approach together with Bayesian modeling has been applied in the ABM to explore the spread of CL. The model is then adapted locally for Isfahan Province, an endemic area in central Iran. The results from the model indicate that desertification areas are the main origin of CL, and riverside population centers have the potential to host more sand fly exposures and should receive more preventive measures from healthcare authorities. The results also show that healthcare service accessibility prevented exposures from becoming infected and areas with new inhabitants experienced more infections from same amount of sand fly exposures.

To reduce losses from such an assault, big cities have developed evacuation policies in case of bombardment.

Agent-based modeling and simulation could be utilized as a method to obtain the footing data. In this paper, we develop an evacuation agent-based model that describes a massive evacuation through the road network of a metropolis during a bombardment. In particular, our model took account of bombing strategies (i.e. the military view) as well as the characteristics of roads and evacuation agents (i.e. the civilian view) in order to analyze evacuations from both military and civilian perspectives. Moreover, we applied real data from a target region to calibrate parameters and initial conditions of the evacuation agent-based models, which increased the reliability of simulation results.

Spatial transmission of pathogens through landscapes, therefore, presents an important but not fully elucidated aspect of transmission dynamics. Using an agent-based model (LiNK) that incorporates GIS data, we examined the effects of landscape information on the spatial patterns of host movement and pathogen transmission in a system of long-tailed macaques and their gut parasites. We first examined the role of the landscape to identify any individual or additive effects on host movement. We then compared modeled dispersal distance to patterns of actual macaque gene flow to both confirm our model's predictions and to understand the role of individual land uses on dispersal. Finally, we compared the rate and the spread of two gastrointestinal parasites, Entamoeba histolytica and E. dispar, to understand how landscape complexity influences spatial patterns of pathogen transmission. Results: LiNK captured emergent properties of the landscape, finding that interaction effects between landscape layers could mitigate the rate of infection in a non-additive way. We also found that the inclusion of landscape information facilitated an accurate prediction of macaque dispersal patterns across a complex landscape, as confirmed by Mantel tests comparing genetic and simulated dispersed distances. Finally, we demonstrated that landscape heterogeneity proved a significant barrier for a highly virulent pathogen, limiting the dispersal ability of hosts and thus its own transmission into distant populations. Conclusions: Landscape complexity plays a significant role in determining the path of host dispersal and patterns of pathogen transmission. Incorporating landscape heterogeneity and host behavior into disease management decisions can be important in targeting response efforts, identifying cryptic transmission opportunities, and reducing or understanding potential for unintended ecological and evolutionary consequences. The inclusion of these data into models of pathogen transmission patterns improves our understanding of these dynamics, ultimately proving beneficial for sound public health policy.",25-Sep,2013,13,,10.1186/1472-6785-13-35,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6785-13-35

Drawing on human geography and the sociospatial perspective in urban sociology, a framework that enables richer and more realistic representation of urban neighborhoods in agent-based simulation models is proposed and outlined. The framework relies on a graph representation of the spatial relations among spatial locations and can accommodate well-defined administrative zones, vague or ill-defined neighborhoods, hierarchically nested spatial zoning systems, overlapping neighborhoods, and changing relations among neighborhoods.

To progress, movement ecology needs an explicit focus on common mechanisms, such as energetics, linking behaviour to fitness consequences across scales, but simplified by process-based approaches, such as individualbased models (IBMs). We review the animal movement literature, from fine-scale patch foraging to large-scale geographic migration, focussing on IBMs incorporating individual energetics (hereafter termed eIBMs). The literature shows IBMs in movement ecology are mainly defined by the following four categories nested across different space and time scales: (1) fine-scale displacement, i.e. foraging and local habitat selection by animals under different resource availabilities, including (2) cognitive processes, such as risk perception, memory and learning, (3) home range occupancy and dispersal potential, and (4) migration and biogeographic distribution. Amongst eIBMs, a common issue emerges: individual traits like energetics are sometimes species and problem-specific, leading to divergence in the way energetics are incorporated and aggregated in the models. Further, movement becomes more difficult to predict with increasing time and space scales and behaviour and biological complexity. Using this individual-level approach, we show 1) it is most effective in explaining fine-scale movement (foraging and competition) where the links between the animal and their habitat are immediate and absolute compared to coarser time and space scales, 2) coarser time and space scales present further challenges for the animal that require more careful interpretation of movement drivers, and 3) common, but more complex behaviours across scales, such as risk perception and memory, are better explained with richer ecological data that are well-integrated into movement models.

The modeling of ecological processes such as insect disturbance is challenging due to the complexity of insect outbreaks in forest ecological systems, thus diverse spatial scales need to be considered in order to effectively represent these dynamic spatial phenomena. The objective of the study is to develop a hybrid model that combines swarm intelligence (SI), agent-based modeling (ABM) and cellular automata (CA) with geographic information systems (GIS) for simulating tree mortality patterns introduced by insect infestations at a landscape spatial scale. The focus is on lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta, tree mortality patterns caused by infestations of mountain pine beetle (MPB). Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins. The complexity of the insects' behavior during forest disturbances can be captured and simulated by an intelligent ABM. Agents represent insects that have the ability to behave and adapt according to their interactions within the forest environment at a very fine spatial scale at tree-level, and with the use of swarming intelligence approach. However, due to computational complexity such model is not operational at landscape and regional spatial scales where the consequences of infestation phenomenon are most obvious. Therefore, the integration of the ABM with CA approach is proposed to handle modeling at both fine and large spatial scales. The discrete nature of CA enables integration with raster-based geospatial datasets in GIS, and can also be beneficial when modeling complex ecological processes that evolve over time. The developed model includes factors such as wind directions and elevation to demonstrate their influence in the spread patterns of the outbreaks at a landscape spatial scale. The model outcomes provide what if scenarios that can assist studying and controlling MPB forest disturbance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Named MUSE (ModUlar energy systems Simulation Environment), this new agent-based model supports flexible characterisation of agent decision-making, including individual goals, bounded-rationality, imperfect foresight, and limited knowledge during the decision process. MUSE integrates this agent-based approach in a partial-equilibrium framework and enables a technology-rich description of the energy systems with an unprecedented degree of flexibility for including technological, temporal, and geographical granularity. The structure of MUSE creates the ability to produce climate change mitigation assessments that are more grounded, and more tangible model outputs for conceiving effective approaches to mitigation.

Social restrictions with different efficiencies were put in place to avoid transmission. Students living in student accommodation constitute an interesting group to test restrictions because they share living places, workplaces and daily routines, which are key factors in the transmission. In this paper, we present a new geospatial agent-based simulation model to explore the transmission of COVID-19 between students living in Newcastle University accommodation and the efficiency of simulated restrictions (e.g., facemask, lockdown, self-isolation). Results showed that facemasks could reduce infection peak by 30% if worn by all students; an early lockdown could keep 65% of the students safe in the best case; self-isolation could keep 86% of the students safe; while the combination of these measures could prevent disease in 95% of students in the best case-scenario. Spatial analyses showed that the most dangerous places were those where many students interact for a long time, such as faculties and accommodation. The developed ABM could help university managers to respond to current and future epidemics and plan effective responses to keep safe as many students as possible.",AUG,2021,10,8,10.3390/ijgi10080509,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10080509

Moreover, CWD has been detected in captive cervids in South Korea and, in recent years, in free-ranging reindeer in Europe (Norway). Management of this disease is limited by logistical, financial, and sociopolitical considerations, and current strategies primarily focus on reducing host densities through hunter harvest and targeted culling. The success of such strategies in mitigating the spread and prevalence of CWD only upon detection is questionable. Here, we propose a proactive approach that emphasizes pre-emptive management through purposeful integration of virtual experiments (simulating alternate interventions as model scenarios) with the aim of evaluating their effectiveness. Here, we have used a published agent-based model that links white-tailed deer demography and behavior with CWD transmission dynamics to first derive a CWD outbreak trajectory and then use the trajectory to highlight issues associated with different phases of the CWD outbreak (pre-establishment/transition/endemic). Specifically, we highlight the practical constraints on surveillance in the pre-establishment phase and recommend that agencies use a realistic detection threshold for their CWD surveillance programs. We further demonstrate that many disease introductions are dead ends not leading to a full epidemic due to high stochasticity and harvesting in the pre-establishment phase of CWD. Model evaluated pre-emptive (pre-detection) harvest strategies could increase the resilience of the deer population to CWD spread and establishment.

Considering, though, the substantial hurdles involved in collecting individual data for whole populations, this study introduces a first approach of simulating human movement and interaction behaviour, using Agent Based Modelling (ABM). A city scale ABM was developed for urban Thessaloniki, Greece that feeds into population-based exposure assessment without imposing prior bias, basing its estimations onto emerging properties of the behaviour of the computerised autonomous decision makers (agents) that compose the city-system. Population statistics, road and buildings networks data were transformed into human, road and building agents, respectively. Survey outputs with time-use patterns were associated with human agent rules, aiming to model representative to real-world behaviours. Moreover, time-geography of exposure data, derived from a local sensors campaign, was used to inform and enhance the model. As a prevalence of an agent-specific decision-making, virtual individuals of different sociodemographic backgrounds express different spatiotemporal behaviours and their trajectories are coupled with spatially resolved pollution levels. Personal exposure was evaluated by assigning PM concentrations to human agents based on coordinates, type of location and intensity of encountered activities. Study results indicated that PM2.5 inhalation adjusted exposure between housemates can differ by 56.5% whereas exposure between two neighbours can vary by as much as 87%, due to the prevalence of different behaviours. This study provides details of a new methodology that permits the cost-effective construction of refined time activity diaries and daily exposure profiles, taking into account different microenvironments and sociodemographic characteristics. The proposed method leads to a refined exposure assessment model, addressing effectively vulnerable subgroups of population.

This paper proposes a new diffusion forecasting approach for residential EV and charging stations using agent-based modeling. Residential EV adoption is treated as a multi-criteria decision making problem modeled via analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The customer adoption model CANE is developed considering customer characteristics including car age, EV attractiveness valued using logistic regression, neighbor influences and customer economics. Distribution feeder topology is combined with property geographic information system (GIS) parcels and household travel survey data to determine geographic and electric locations for EV and charging stations. A Monte Carlo method is utilized to obtain the most likely outcome of the stochastic vehicle decision-making process and perform model calibration. The proposed diffusion forecasting approach is demonstrated using actual distribution feeder data. Using the diffusion results, EV impact on system annual peak, energy, losses, transformer aging and feeder upgrades is evaluated using quasi-static time-series power flow analysis.

Due to the separation of jobs and housing, spatial dislocations have occurred in large cities, which have resulted in a significant increase in commuting distance and time. These changes have ultimately led to an increase in pressure on urban traffic, and the formation of tidal traffic. In this study we introduce a multi-agent approach to examine the jobs-housing relationship under the maximum location utility of agents. The jobs/housing ratio measures the balance of the of jobs-housing relationship, as well as comparing and analyzing jobs-housing separation in Beijing by district, county, and street scales. An agent-based model was proposed to simulate spatial location selection behavior of agents by considering environmental and economical influences on residential decisions of individuals. Results show that the jobs-housing relationship imbalance in Beijing has been mainly aggravated due to rapid population growth in the 6th Ring Road. An imbalance in the jobs-housing relationship has arisen due to a mismatch with the number of households available compared to the number of jobs; the surrounding urban areas cannot provide the required volume of housing to accommodate the increase in workers. Six sets of experiments were established to examine resident agents and enterprise agents. Differences in resident agents' income level had a greater impact on residential location decision-making, and housing price was the primary factor affecting the decision of residents to choose their residential location. The spatial distribution of jobs and housing in Beijing under the maximization of micro-agent location utility was obtained in this study. Results indicated that the imbalance in the jobs not sign -housing relationship in central Beijing has improved and, compared with the initial distributions, the number of jobs-housing balance areas in Beijing has increased.",JAN,2021,10,1,10.3390/ijgi10010016,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10010016

Simulation modeling of food access within FDs may help decision-makers and urban planners cost-effectively test solutions to food accessibility, and determine which interventions are best able to mitigate negative effects on FD residents. This work devises an adaptive framework that can inexpensively simulate FDs and assess which policy and built environment disruptors-e.g., expanded bus routes, increased pedestrian safety infrastructure, new grocery stores-generate the greatest increase in food access. This framework combines Agent-Based Modeling, GIS, and Discrete Event Simulation to determine the percent of FD residents without food access (as defined by the USDA) before and after a disruptor is introduced. To assess its functionality, the framework was applied to a case study region in Austin, Texas. Results indicate the modeled disruptors improved food access between 2-45%, depending on the type of disruptor, its location, and the distance residents are willing to walk. Notably, results demonstrate how applying this framework allows one to (1) inexpensively test proposed solutions to food-access issues before large-scale capital investments are made; (2) identify emergent behavior that influence disruptors' efficacy; and (3) identify unique, area-specific solutions that achieve more sustainable improvements in food access.",JAN,2020,52,,10.1016/j.scs.2019.101795,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2019.101795

However, such application has remained challenging in forest insect epidemics due to the highly dynamic nature of insect behavior. Recent advances in temporal trajectory-based image analysis offer an alternative way to obtain high-frequency model calibration data. In this study, we propose an insect-CA modeling framework that integrates cellular automata, remote sensing, and Geographic Information System to understand the insect ecological processes, and tested it with measured data of mountain pine beetle (MPB) in the Rocky Mountains. The overall accuracy of the predicted MPB mortality pattern in the test years ranged from 88% to 94%, which illuminates its effectiveness in modeling forest insect dynamics. We further conducted sensitivity analysis to examine responses of model performance to various parameter settings. In our case, the ensemble random forest algorithm outperforms the traditional linear regression in constructing the suitability surface. Small neighborhood size is more effective in simulating the MPB movement behavior, indicating that short-distance is the dominating dispersal mode of MPB. The introduction of a stochastic perturbation component did not improve the model performance after testing a broad range of randomness degree, reflecting a relative compact dispersal pattern rather than isolated outbreaks. We conclude that CA with remote sensing observation is useful for landscape insect movement analyses; however, consideration of several key parameters is critical in the modeling process and should be more thoroughly investigated in future work.

We define them as corridors established between a gateway port, where goods are imported, and urban areas, where the final distributors are located. The efficient management of the flow of goods operated on these corridors requires a structured territory and organized actors. Decentralized decisions of actors and interactions between them make it possible to provide consistent logistic services despite the numerous system constraints (legal, environmental, economical, ... ). Our goal is to reproduce the behavior of logistic systems through simulation. Our approach consists of describing the dynamics of such a system at a micro level. Therefore, we first enumerate the local properties, constraints and behaviors of each main actor and the infrastructures of this territory in order to extract the essential elements' that will be part of the theoretical model. A major aspect of the model is the description of the interface between maritime dynamics (schedule on a day-basis) and metropolitan dynamics (scheduled on an hour basis). This interface is self-organized: macro characteristics emerge from local properties and rules. It is revealing of a complex system, working on different scales, that we model with agents and dynamic graphs. Each actor and infrastructure is represented with agents. The transportation network is a multi-modal dynamic graph that makes possible to model the traffic and topology evolution. This approach enables users, like public authorities, to modify local parameters and observe their effects at the macro level. Thus users can identify levers to control the whole system. We execute some simulations with data on the Seine axis to confront our results with a real case study. We provide some measures (e.g. number of vehicles and quantity of goods) to show that the simulation reproduces the atomization process of logistic flows.

A modelling approach to explore hypotheses of late Neolithic crop cultivation in pre-alpine wetland sites,VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY,"The record of prehistoric crop cultivation in central Europe dates as far back as 5500 bc. In the pile-dwellings of the north-western pre-alpine forelands, dating roughly from 4300 to 800 bc, favourable taphonomic conditions provide evidence for the ways of cereal cultivation and consumption in unmatched detail. Based on different sets of (bio-) archaeological and palynological evidence, different hypotheses of crop husbandry methods have been developed for the wetland settlements. During the late Neolithic, two partly antithetic ideas are discussed: On one hand Shifting Cultivation assumes frequently shifted crop fields and the use of fire to provide nitrogen for plant uptake; On the other hand Permanent Cultivation reconstructs longer-ranging use of the fields, to which nitrogen may have been provided by various means. From the Bronze Age onwards, most probably some form of extensive ard cultivation was applied. In this article, we explore the implications of the different hypotheses for the socio-ecological system of the wetland sites. We combine the capability of agent-based modelling to simulate dynamic processes with the benefits provided by geographical information systems and the possibilities provided by the use of modern agro-ecosystem modelling tools. First, we used a mechanistic crop growth model, MONICA, to evaluate the influence of important factors of prehistoric crop yield formation: the climatic conditions, the soil texture and the degree of nitrogen availability. Second, we applied an agent-based model (WELASSIMO_crops) to simulate the spatial and economic implications related to the different crop husbandry methods. Our results provide quantitative information on the extent of crop husbandry activities in the wetland sites and on the effect of natural and anthropogenic factors on prehistoric crop yields. Without manure application, initial average yields of 1.0 t ha(-1) a(-1) are shown to decrease rapidly to only 50 % after 10 years. A manuring rate of 10 t ha(-1) a(-1) allows for higher yields of 1.7 t ha(-1) a(-1) and a slower rate of fertility decrease, but requires high numbers of livestock per capita. In shifting cultivation, high yields of 2.7 t ha(-1) a(-1) are reasonable, while necessitating a very large area and high labour input. Using the model results and a case study, we argue that permanent cultivation is more likely to have been the standard method, while burning of the landscape may have had different objectives than crop husbandry.

These studies identified critical factors influencing epidemic spread, but they also left important questions unanswered. The objective of this project was to design a more realistic agent-based model that would overcome limitations of earlier models and provide new insights into these outstanding questions. Methods: The new model extends the previous agent-based model to three communities so that results can be compared to those from the population-based model. Sensitivity testing was conducted, and the new model was used to investigate the influence of seasonal settlement and mobility patterns, the geographic heterogeneity of the observed 1918-1919 epidemic in Manitoba, and other questions addressed previously. Results: Results confirm outcomes from the population-based model that suggest that (a) social organization and mobility strongly influence the timing and severity of epidemics and (b) the impact of the epidemic would have been greater if it had arrived in the summer rather than the winter. New insights from the model suggest that the observed heterogeneity among communities in epidemic impact was not unusual and would have been the expected outcome given settlement structure and levels of interaction among communities. Conclusions: Application of an agent-based computer simulation has helped to better explain observed patterns of spread of the 1918-1919 flu epidemic in central Manitoba.

"Mansury, Y; Deisboeck, TS",Simulating the time series of a selected gene expression profile in an agent-based tumor model,PHYSICA D-NONLINEAR PHENOMENA,"To elucidate the role of environmental conditions in molecular-level dynamics and to study their impact on macroscopic brain tumor growth patterns, the expression of the genes Tenascin C and PCNA in a 2D agent-based model for the migratory trait is calibrated using experimental data from the literature, while the expression of these genes for the proliferative trait is obtained as the model output. Numerical results confirm that the gene expression of Tenascin C is indeed consistently higher in the migratory glioma cell phenotype and show that the expression of PCNA is consistently higher among proliferating tumor cells. Intriguingly, the time series of the tumor cells' gene expression exhibit a sudden change in behavior during the invasion of the tumor into a nutrient-abundant region, showing a robust positive correlation between the expression of Tenascin C and the tumor's diameter, yet a strong negative correlation between the expression of PCNA and the diameter. These molecular-level dynamics correspond to the emergence of a structural asymmetry in the form of a bulging tumor rim in the nutrient-abundant region. The simulated time series thus supports the critical role of the migratory cell phenotype during both the tumor system's overall macroscopic expansion and the evolvement of regional growth patterns, particularly in the later stages. Furthermore, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) suggests that for prediction purposes, the simulated gene expression profiles of Tenascin C and PCNA that were determined separately for the migrating and proliferating phenotypes exhibit lesser predictability than those of the phenotypic mixture combining all viable tumor cells typically found in clinical biopsies. Finally, partitioning the tumor into distinct geographic regions of interest (ROI) reveals that the gene expression profile of tumor cells in the quadrant close to the nutrient-abundant region is representative for the entire tumor whereas the expression profile of tumor cells in the geographically opposite ROI is not. Potential implications of these modeling results for experimental and clinical cancer research are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In this regard, an important challenge is employing woody biomass effectively and considering the lower environmental emissions, transportation, and emissions cost of the supply chain and activities needed to convert biomass into a valued energy source. Geographical scale, distribution, and the type of transportation of waste wood cause considerable challenges to meet the economic and environmental sustainability of the woody biomass supply chain (BSC). This study aims to develop an integrated Geographical Information System and Agent-based simulation modeling tool to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the particle-gaseous pollutant emissions and transportation cost of woody BSC. The two main forms of land freight, train and truck, with three sizes of capacity (light, medium, and heavy) are considered for the study. Scenario analysis is conducted to measure the particle-gaseous pollutant emissions and transportation costs of woody BSC. The developed model is tested through a case study in Victoria, Australia. Results showed that a combination of truck and train transport with increasing size and capacity of container leads to a reduction of around 60% gaseous pollutant emissions. Using 80% train transportation mode by suppliers would reduce emissions cost by 58%. Using rail transport emitted higher particulate emissions, and trucks with higher capacity reduced the particulate emissions by 55%. Results also depict that the higher capacity of containers leads to a decrease of at least 50% emissions cost. Harvesting and collection include 50% of total production costs. Finally, the sensitivity analysis results revealed that the factors with the highest impact on the overall transportation and emission costs of woody BSC are those in relation to transport network (i.e., type, capacity, and distance).Australian Renewable Energy Agency, the Australian Government and biomass industry stockholders may apply these results to define and develop plans and policies to contribute towards delivering net zero emissions by 2050.

"Hwang, Yujeong; Heo, Gyunyoung",Development of a radiological emergency evacuation model using agent-based modeling,NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY,"In order to mitigate the damage caused by accidents in nuclear power plants (NPPs), evacuation strategies are usually managed on the basis of off-site effects such as the diffusion of radioactive materials and evacuee traffic simulations. However, the interactive behavior between evacuees and the accident environment has a significant effect on the consequential gap. Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a method that can control and observe such interactions by establishing agents (i.e., the evacuees) and patches (i.e., the accident environments). In this paper, a radiological emergency evacuation model is constructed to realistically check the effectiveness of an evacuation strategy using NetLogo, an ABM toolbox. Geographic layers such as radiation sources, roads, buildings, and shelters were downloaded from an official geographic information system (GIS) of Korea, and were modified into respective patches. The dispersion model adopted from the puff equation was also modified to fit the patches on the geographic layer. The evacuees were defined as vehicle agents and a traffic model was implemented by combining the shortest path search (determined by an A * algorithm) and a traffic flow model incorporated in the NagelSchreckenberg cellular automata model. To evaluate the radiological harm to the evacuees due to the spread of radioactive materials, a simple exposure model was established to calculate the overlap fraction between the agents and the dispersion patches. This paper aims to demonstrate that the potential of ABM can handle disaster evacuation strategies more realistically than previous approaches.

In turn, this may result in economic and social inequalities within the context of rapid economic growth. Provision of flexible transit in fast-growing cities is a promising strategy to overcome the limits of conventional public transport and avoid the use of private cars, towards better accessibility and social inclusion. This paper presents the case of Dubai (UAE), where a demand responsive transit service called MVMANT (a company based in Italy) has been tested in some low demand districts. The contribution of this work relies on the use of an agent-based model calibrated with Geographic Information System (GIS) real data to reproduce the service and find optimal configurations from both the perspective of the transport operator and the community. Different scenarios were simulated, by changing the vehicle assignment strategy and capacity, and comparing MVMANT with a ride-sharing service with smaller vehicles. Results suggest that route choice strategy is important to find a balance between operator and user costs, and that these types of flexible transit can satisfy transport demand with limited total costs compared to other shared mobility services. They can also be effective in satisfying fluctuating demand by adopting heterogeneous fleets of vehicles. Finally, appropriate planning and evaluation of these services are needed to fully explore their potential in covering the gap between low-quality fixed public transport and unsustainable private transport.",JUN,2020,12,11,10.3390/su12114455,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12114455
"Loraamm, Rebecca W.",Incorporating behavior into animal movement modeling: a constrained agent-based model for estimating visit probabilities in space-time prisms,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE,"Animal movement is a dynamic spatio-temporal process. While trajectory data reflect the instantaneous animal position in space and time, other factors influence movement decisions between these observed positions. While some methods incorporate environmental (habitat) context into their understanding of the animal movement process, it is often captured in terms of simple parameters or weights influencing model results; primary behavioral data are not used directly to inform these models. Here, a new space-time constrained agent-based model is introduced, capable of producing ordered, behaviorally informed animal potential paths between observed space-time anchors. Potential paths generated by this approach incorporate both observed animal behavior and classical space-time constraints, and are used to construct associated visit probability distributions. Additionally, the notion of a behavioral space-time path is introduced, a variant of the space-time path based on the results of behaviorally aware animal movement simulation. The results of this approach demonstrate a means to better understand the varied movement opportunities within space-time prisms from an animal behavior perspective. From a spatial ecology perspective, not only is the environmental context considered, but the animal's choice of transition and movement magnitude between contexts is modeled. This approach provides insight into the complex sequence of behaviorally informed actions driving animal movement decision-making.",2-Aug,2020,34,8,10.1080/13658816.2019.1658875,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2019.1658875
"Jin, Zhu; Northridge, Mary E.; Metcalf, Sara S.",Modeling the influence of social ties and transportation choice on access to oral healthcare for older adults,APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,"The current U.S. demographic shift toward an older population and the importance of intervening before conditions become severe warrant a concerted effort to ease the burden of access to healthcare for older adults. With regard to oral healthcare, more integrated services for older adults are needed to effectively serve their complex medical and dental needs. Using an agent-based simulation model, this paper examines the influence of social ties and transportation mode choices on opportunities for older adults to participate in community-based preventive screening events and access needed oral healthcare. This approach accounts for the heterogeneity of behavior that arises for a population exhibiting diversity in terms of social factors, including socioeconomic means and social support. In the context of older adults living in urban environments, the availability of different transportation modes ought to be taken into consideration. To explore alternative scenarios for the accessibility of preventive screening events offered at senior centers in northern Manhattan, an agent-based model (ABM) was created with a geographic information system (GIS) to simulate the influence of social ties and transportation choices on older adults seeking preventive screening services and oral healthcare. Results of simulation experiments indicate preferences for public transportation and inequities in accessibility that may be mitigated with social support. This simulation model offers a way to explore social support as an important factor in making transportation mode choices that mediate oral healthcare accessibility and thus oral health outcomes for older adults.",JUL,2018,96,,10.1016/j.apgeog.2018.05.005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2018.05.005

These trips take place in the winter season, when the temperatures in the North fall and food supply drops. White storks, because of their large size, depend on the wind, thermals, and orographic characteristics of the environment in order to minimize their energy expenditure during flight. In particular, the birds adopt a soaring behavior in landscapes where the thermal uplift and orographic updrafts are conducive. By attaining suitable soaring heights, the birds then use the wind characteristics to glide for hundreds of kilometers. It is therefore expected that white storks would prefer landscapes that are characterized by suitable wind and thermal characteristics, which promote the soaring and gliding behaviors. However, these same landscapes are also potential sites for large-scale wind energy generation. In this study, we used the observed data of the white stork movement trajectories to specify a data-driven agent-based model, which simulates flight behavior of the white storks in a dynamic environment. The data on the wind characteristics and thermal uplift are dynamically changed on a daily basis so as to mimic the scenarios that the observed birds experienced during flight. The flight corridors that emerge from the simulated flights are then combined with the predicted surface on the wind energy potential, in order to highlight the potential risk of collision between the migratory white storks and hypothetical wind farms in the locations that are suitable for wind energy developments. This work provides methods that can be adopted to assess the overlap between wind energy potential and migratory corridors of the migration of birds. This can contribute to achieving sustainable trade-offs between wind energy development and conservation of wildlife and, hence, handling the issues of human-wildlife conflicts.",MAY,2018,10,5,10.3390/su10051470,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10051470

"Pooyandeh, Majeed; Marceau, Danielle J.",Incorporating Bayesian learning in agent-based simulation of stakeholders' negotiation,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,"This paper describes the incorporation of a Bayesian learning algorithm into an agent-based model designed to simulate stakeholders' negotiation when evaluating scenarios of land development. The objective is to facilitate reaching an agreement at an earlier stage in the negotiation by providing the opportunity to the proposer agent to learn his opponents' preferences. The modeling approach is tested in the Elbow River watershed, in southern Alberta, Canada, that is under considerable pressure for land development due to the proximity of the fast growing city of Calgary. Five agents are included in the model respectively referred to as the Developer agent, the Planner agent, the Citizen agent, the Agriculture-Concerned agent, and the WaterConcerned agent. Two types of land development scenarios are evaluated; in the first case, only the geographical location is considered while in the second case, the internal land-use composition is also varied. The Developer agent that is equipped with the Bayesian learning capability attempts to approximate its opponents' fuzzy evaluation functions based on the responses he receives from them at each round of the negotiation. The results indicate that using this approach, an agreement can be reached in fewer number of negotiation rounds than in the case where the Developer agent selects the subsequent offers based merely on its own utility. The model also indicates how the satisfaction of each agent evolves during the negotiation. This information is very useful for decision makers who wish to consider stakeholders' perspectives when dealing with multiple objectives in a spatial context. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

White tailed deer (WTD) sustain and spread cattle tick populations. The aim of this study was to model the efficacy of anti-tick vaccination of WTD to control tick infestations in the absence of cattle vaccination in a territory where both host species coexist and sustain cattle tick populations. Agent-based models that included land cover/landscape properties (patch size, distances to patches) and climatic conditions were built in a GIS environment to simulate WTD vaccine effectiveness under conditions where unvaccinated cattle shared the landscape. Published and validated information on tick life cycle was used to build models describing tick mortality and developmental rates. Data from simulations were applied to a large territory in northeastern Mexico where cattle ticks are endemic and WTD and cattle share substantial portions of the habitat. WTD movements were simulated together with tick population dynamics considering the actual landscape and climatic features. The size of the vegetation patches and the distance between patches were critical for the successful control of tick infestations after WTD vaccination. The presence of well-connected, large vegetation patches proved essential for tick control, since the tick could persist in areas of highly fragmented habitat. The continued application of one yearly vaccination on days 1-70 for three years reduced tick abundance/animal/patch by a factor of 40 and 60 for R. annulatus and R. microplus, respectively when compared to non-vaccinated controls. The study showed that vaccination of WTD alone during three consecutive years could result in the reduction of cattle tick populations in northeastern Mexico. Furthermore, the results of the simulations suggested the possibility of using vaccines to prevent the spread and thus the re-introduction of cattle ticks into tick-free areas.",21-Jul,2014,9,7,10.1371/journal.pone.0102905,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0102905

In this article we use a Schelling-like agent-based model to consider how changes to the built environment of cities relate to changes in residential segregation by income and ethnicity. To develop this model we exploit insights from a high resolution historical GIS which maps 100% of the population of Newark, NJ in 1880. Newark in 1880 had a complex social landscape characterized by areas of significant social and economic segregation and areas of relative integration. We develop a Schelling model capable of reproducing these residential patterns. We use this model to explore the decentralization of housing, a specific phenomenon associated with the demise of the walking city in the late 19th century. Holding agent preferences constant, but allowing the landscape of the Schelling model to evolve in ways that reflect historical changes to the built environment, produces changes to the social landscape that are also consistent with history. Our work suggests that changes in residential segregation do not necessarily imply changes to individual attitudes and preferences. Changes in residential segregation can be generated by changes to the built environment, specifically the geographic distribution of housing.",FEB,2014,18,1,10.1111/tgis.12014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12014

We propose a mixing pattern of modular and growing hierarchical structures to reconstruct social contact networks by using an individual's geospatial distribution information in the real world. The hierarchical structure of social contact networks is defined based on the spatial distance between individuals, and edges among individuals are added in turn from the modular layer to the highest layer. It is a gradual process to construct the hierarchical structure: from the basic modular model up to the global network. The proposed model not only shows hierarchically increasing degree distribution and large clustering coefficients in communities, but also exhibits spatial clustering features of individual distributions. As an evaluation of the method, we reconstruct a hierarchical contact network based on the investigation data of a university. Transmission experiments of influenza H1N1 are carried out on the generated social contact networks, and results show that the constructed network is efficient to reproduce the dynamic process of an outbreak and evaluate interventions. The reproduced spread process exhibits that the spatial clustering of infection is accordant with the clustering of network topology. Moreover, the effect of individual topological character on the spread of influenza is analyzed, and the experiment results indicate that the spread is limited by individual daily contact patterns and local clustering topology rather than individual degree.

This paper addresses these issues through the development of a computational framework for modeling and simulating infectious disease outbreaks in a specific geographic region facilitating the quantification of public health policy decisions. Effectively modeling and simulating past epidemics to project current or future disease outbreaks will lead to improved control and intervention policies and disaster preparedness. In this paper, we introduce a computational framework that brings together spatio-temporal geography and population demographics with specific disease pathology in a novel simulation paradigm termed, global stochastic field simulation (GSFS). The primary aim of this simulation paradigm is to facilitate intelligent what-if-analysis in the event of health crisis, such as an influenza pandemic. The dynamics of any epidemic are intrinsically related to a region's spatio-temporal characteristics and demographic composition and as such, must be considered when developing infectious disease control and intervention strategies. Similarly, comparison of past and current epidemics must include demographic changes into any effective public health policy for control and intervention strategies. GSFS is a hybrid approach to modeling, implicitly combining agent-based modeling with the cellular automata paradigm. Specifically, GSFS is a computational framework that will facilitate the effective identification of risk groups in the population and determine adequate points of control, leading to more effective surveillance and control of infectious diseases epidemics. The analysis of past disease outbreaks in a given population and the projection of current or future epidemics constitutes a significant challenge to Public Health.

Marine mammals and fishes are two prominent taxonomic groups that are exposed to this noise pollution, which may experience detrimental effects at the population level. Acoustic effects on individual behaviour such as deterrence, disturbance, distraction and masking of biologically relevant sounds, can be translated energetically to changes in vital rates (growth, maturation, reproduction and survival) in a population consequences of acoustic disturbance (PCAD) approach. However, we typically neglect spatial variation in species distributions and noise pollution, while abiotic factors like temperature, bathymetry and currents, as well as habitat quality in terms of feeding or hiding opportunities, will also have a geographically variable impact on potential consequences.

TGDE has recently been proposed as a method of animal home range estimation, where the goal is to delineate the spatial extents that an animal occupies. This paper tests TGDE's effectiveness as a home range estimator using simulated movement data. First, an agent-based model is used to simulate tracking data under 16 movement scenarios representing a variety of animal life history traits (habitat preferences, homing behaviour, mobility) and habitat configurations (levels of habitat fragmentation). Second, the accuracy of TGDE is evaluated for four temporal sampling frequencies using three adaptive velocity parameters for 30 sample data sets from each scenario.

The results demonstrate that TGDE is the most effective at estimating core areas, home ranges and total areas at high sampling frequencies, while CHP performs better at low sampling frequencies.

"Magliocca, Nicholas R.; Ellis, Erle C.",Evolving human landscapes: a virtual laboratory approach,JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE,"Different human societies shape landscapes differently. Anthroecology theory explains this long-term differential shaping of landscapes as the product of sociocultural niche construction (SNC): an evolutionary theory coupling social change with ecosystem engineering. The evolutionary mechanisms underpinning this theory cannot be tested without experimental approaches capable of reproducing emergent selection processes acting on the combined suite of cultural, material, and ecological inheritances that determine the adaptive fitness of human individuals, groups, and societies. Agent-based modeling, as a ` generative social science' tool, appears ideal for this. Here we propose an agentbased virtual laboratory (ABVL) approach to generating and testing basic hypotheses on SNC as a general mechanism capable of producing the broadly varied anthroecological forms and dynamics of human landscapes from prehistory to present. While major challenges must still be overcome, a prospective modeling framework specification, guiding questions, and illustrative examples demonstrate clear potential for an ABVL to test predictions of anthroecology theory through generative social simulation.",,2016,11,6,10.1080/1747423X.2016.1241314,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1747423X.2016.1241314

At the same time, there has been concern over whether palaeoecological enquiry needs to move beyond descriptive inference to a more hypothesis-focussed, or experimental approach. However, the extent to which conventional hypothesis-driven scientific frameworks can be applied to historical contexts (i.e., the past) is the subject of ongoing debate. In other disciplines concerned with human-environment interactions, including physical geography and archaeology, there has been growing use of generative simulation models, typified by agent-based approaches. Generative modeling encourages counter-factual questioning (what if...?,) a mode of argument that is particularly important in systems and time-periods, such as the Holocene, and now the Anthropocene, where the effects of humans and other biophysical processes are deeply intertwined. However, palaeoecologically focused simulation of the dynamics of the ecosystems of the past either seems to be conducted to assess the applicability of some model to the future or treats humans simplistically as external forcing factors. In this review we consider how generative simulation-modeling approaches could contribute to our understanding of past human-environment interactions. We consider two key issues: the need for null models for understanding past dynamics and the need to be able learn more from pattern-based analysis. In this light, we argue that there is considerable scope for palaeoecology to benefit from developments in generative models and their evaluation. We discuss the view that simulation is a form of experiment and by using case studies, consider how the many patterns available to palaeoecologists can support model evaluation in a way that moves beyond simplistic pattern-matching and how such models might also inform us about the data themselves and the processes generating them. Our emphasis is on how generative simulation might complement traditional palaeoecological methods and proxies rather than on a detailed overview of the modeling methods themselves.",,2016,4,,10.3389/fevo.2016.00109,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2016.00109

This paper introduces an integrative, applicable framework of Complex Distributed Agent Networks (CoDAN) for infrastructure risk assessment and management. CoDAN detects sub-systems at multiple geographical scales and associates decision units (agents) to them in the context of a decision problem. Agents use advanced optimization and risk assessment methods for decision support, and allow to model decentralized yet coordinated decisions about performance and risk management (e.g., maintenance or restoration), mimicking behavior and system response observed in practice. The application of CoDAN to illustrative examples shows the potential of the framework to unravel the complex evolution of infrastructure network performance under hazard exposure, and to reduce the computational burden of tasks associated to risk assessment and management, as compared to traditional centralized formulations.

Simulation of population dynamics can provide useful information to urban planning for rapidly developing manufacturing metropolises. In such a metropolis with a concentration of immigrant labor forces, individual employment choices could have a significant effect on their residential decisions. There remains a need for an efficient method, which can simulate spatial population dynamics by considering the interactions between employment and residential choices. This article proposes an agent-based model for simulation of spatial population dynamics by addressing the influence of labor market on individual residential decisions. Labor economics theory is incorporated into a multi-agent system in this model. The long-term equilibrium process of labor market is established to define the interactions between labor supply and labor demand. An agent-based approach is adopted to simulate the economic behaviors and residential decisions of population individuals. The residential decisions of individuals would eventually have consequences on spatial population dynamics. The proposed model has been verified by the spatial dynamics simulation (2007 to 2010) of Dongguan, an emerging and renowned manufacturing metropolis in the Pearl River Delta, China. The results indicate that the simulated population size and spatial distribution of each town in Dongguan are close to those obtained from census data. The proposed model is also applied to predict spatial population dynamics based on two economic planning scenarios in Dongguan from 2010 to2015.

"Long, Ying; Shen, Zhenjiang",Disaggregating heterogeneous agent attributes and location,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,"The use of micro-models as supplements for macro-models has become an accepted approach into the investigation of urban dynamics. However, the widespread application of micro-models has been hindered by a dearth of individual data, due to privacy and cost constraints. A number of studies have been conducted to generate synthetic individual data by reweighting large-scale surveys. The present study focused on individual disaggregation without micro-data from any large-scale surveys. Specifically, a series of steps termed Agenter (a portmanteau of agent producer) is proposed to disaggregate heterogeneous agent attributes and locations from aggregate data, small-scale surveys, and empirical studies. The distribution of and relationships among attributes can be inferred from three types of existing materials to disaggregate agent attributes. Two approaches to determining agent locations are proposed here to meet various data availability conditions. Agenter was initially tested in a synthetic space, then verified using the acquired individual data, which were compared to results generated using a null model. Agenter generated significantly better disaggregation results than the null model, as indicated by the proposed similarity index (SI). Agenter was then used in the Beijing Metropolitan Area to infer the attributes and location of over 10 million residential agents using a census report, a household travel survey, an empirical study, and an urban GIS database. Agenter was validated using micro-samples from the survey, with an average SI of 72.6%. These findings indicate the developed model may be suitable for using in the reproduction of individual data for feeding micro-models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

As the modern agriculture industry promotes rapid spatial pattern changes, modelling this phenom-enon is of considerable interest to urban planners and city managers. Several methods have been developed to simulate the dynamics of land-use changes. However, the complexity of such dynamics can impede the usefulness of simulation methods. In this paper, a new cellular-automata and agent-based model (CA-ABM) is introduced into the spatial simulation and reorganisation of peri-urban areas. This simulation and predictive model uses the geographic information system platform and cellular automata tool. The basic components of this dynamic bottom-up approach are the actors in land-use development. Using six settlements from plains, hilly, and mountainous areas as examples combined with field investigation, remote sensing images, official land-use planning, and other data, this study analysed land-use evolution under the influence of farmers, developers, and government agents to illustrate the spatial simulation and land-use reorganisation mechanism of agricultural suburban settlements.

It includes mass-rearing and release of sterile males of the target species so that wild females mated with sterile males would not produce offspring. An innovative version of this technique, called boosted SIT, relies on the use of sterile males as vectors of biocides to trigger an epizootic in the wild fruit fly population. We built an agent-based model to assess the feasibility of this technique and main modalities of field implementation for the control of the Oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis, using the entomopathogenic fungi, Metarizhium anisopliae, as a biocide. The model, called BOOSTIT (BactrOcera dOrsaliS boosTed sIT), simulates the spatio-temporal population dynamics of fruit flies in three different realistic landscape contexts. The releases of infected and uninfected sterile males were simulated and allowed the transmission of the pathogen within the wild fly population as a result of interactions between individuals. A main output was the measurement of losses in mango production. Validation of the model was done by comparing the simulated population dynamics with data from field monitoring (pheromone traps) in three landscapes of the Niayes area in Senegal. The population dynamics of wild flies were then simulated in an intensive cropping and mono-mango cultivar landscape under three scenarios: (1) without the release of sterile males, (2) with the release of non-contaminated sterile males (SIT) and (3) with the release of sterile contaminated males (boosted SIT). The results showed that SIT and boosted SIT strongly reduced the density of wild flies and the amount of infested fruits. Although parameters of the pathogen transfer between individuals need to be studied more deeply, results encourage the implementation of field trials to validate the efficacy of boosted SIT to control fruit flies.",JUN,2022,468,,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2022.109951,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2022.109951
"Garrett, Karen A.",Impact network analysis and the ina r package: Decision support for regional management interventions,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"The success of intervention projects for species management depends on both the effectiveness of management technologies and the geographical landscape of management adoption. Impact network analysis (INA) is a new framework for evaluating the likely level of success of regional species management before, during and after projects, for project implementers, policymakers and funders. INA evaluates the effects of management performance in a multilayer network analysis. The socioeconomic network represents manager communication about technologies and influence about technology adoption decisions in an agent-based model. The linked biophysical network represents species dispersal, resulting in regional success or failure of species management. The specific objectives of this paper are to (a) introduce the INA framework and ina r package; (b) illustrate the identification of key nodes for smart surveillance strategies; (c) illustrate the application of the INA framework for evaluating the likely degree of success of a project in intervention ecology, before, during and after an intervention; and (d) illustrate the use of INA for evaluating adaptation strategies under global change scenarios with pulse and press stressors, introducing 'adaptation functions' to evaluate the management response required for sustainability and resilience. Examples of use of the ina package show key outcomes of analyses: identifying the limiting factors for effective regional management, pointing out when systems may be non-responsive to the system components that are readily changed through management decisions, and identifying the additional adaptations that may be necessary for intervention success. The broader goals for the development of impact network analysis and the ina package are to provide a common framework that integrates across intervention ecology, to enhance opportunities for lessons learned across systems and scientific disciplines, to support the development of a community of practice, and to create a general platform to operationalize analysis of sustainability, resilience and economic viability in intervention ecology applications.",SEP,2021,12,9,10.1111/2041-210X.13655,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13655

Specifically, this research studies the participation decisions of both senders and carriers over time and the impacts of the resulting feedback loop on platform growth and performance. Design/methodology/approach An agent-based model is developed and used to study dynamic behavior and network effects within a simulated crowd-shipping platform. The model allows both carriers and senders to be represented as autonomous, heterogeneous and adaptive agents, whose decisions to participate in the platform impact the participation of other agents over time. Survey data inform the logic governing agent decisions and behaviors. Findings The feedback loop created by individual sender and carrier agents' participation decisions generates complex and dynamic network effects that are observable at the platform level. Experimental results demonstrate the importance of having sufficient crowd carriers available when the platform is initially launched, as well as ensuring that sender and carrier participation remains balanced as the platform grows over time. Research limitations/implications The model successfully demonstrates the power of agent-based modeling (ABM) in analyzing network effects in crowd-shipping systems. However, the model has not yet been fully validated with data from a real-world crowd-shipping platform. Furthermore, the model's geographic scope is limited to a single census tract. Platform behavior will likely differ across geographic regions, with varying demographics and sender/carrier density. Practical implications The modeling approach can be used to provide the manager of a volunteer-based crowd-shipping program for food rescue with insights on how to achieve a critical mass of participants, with an appropriate balance between the number of restaurant food donation delivery requests and the number of crowd-shippers available and willing to make those deliveries. Social implications This research can help a crowd-shipping platform for urban food rescue to grow and become self-sustainable, thereby serving more food-insecure people. Originality/value The model represents both senders and the carrier crowd as autonomous, heterogeneous and adaptive agents, such that network effects resulting from their interactions can emerge and be observed over time.

The first (Model 1) mimics NYC's current GI program by opportunistically selecting sites for GI within the city's priority combined sewer watersheds; the second (Model 2) features a more spatially flexible approach to GI siting, in which the city attempts to maximize opportunities for co-benefits within the geographic areas considered in Model 1. The effects of both approaches, measured in terms of stormwater captured and co-benefits (e.g., carbon sequestered) provided, are tracked over 20-year simulations. While both models suggest it will be difficult to meet the citywide stormwater capture goals (managing the first 2.5 cm of rainfall from 10% of impervious surfaces) in the Bronx solely through public investment in GI, Model 2 shows that by integrating GI with other city initiatives (e.g., sustainability goals and resilience planning), synergistic outcomes are possible.

The transmission of malaria is associated with the interactions among environment, Anopheles mosquitoes (vectors), and humans (hosts). Plasmodium vivax is one of the four species of malaria parasites that commonly infect humans in Asia, Latin America, and in some parts of Africa. The major difference between this and other parasites is the recurrence of malaria. The main objective of this study is to develop an agent-based model (ABM) for simulating the dynamic spread of P. vivax malaria, based on the interactions of these three elements represented as agents. The SEIRS model is used to simulate the transmission of malaria. The model explanation follows the ODD (Overview, Design concepts, Details) protocol. The transmission of malaria depends on various factors consisting of temperature, humidity, vegetation, altitude, distance from rivers, and the human population density. The main innovation of this study is that the first three factors are assumed changeable and are entered dynamically to the model during the simulation process. In the study area, the malaria occurrence data were available only for each month and only at the county level. Therefore, the processes of calibration and validation of the model were merely based on the temporal pattern of malaria incidence and the Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE). After the calibration of the model, the best value of RMSE calculated for the temporal pattern of malaria spread was 3.155 infected people.

Since then, the methods used in the field have matured, moving beyond simple spatial associations to the use of complex spatial statistics and, on occasions, simulation modelling. Many analyses are often descriptive in nature; however, and the use of more advanced spatial simulation methods within dental public health remains rare, despite the potential they offer the field. This review introduces a new approach to geographical analysis of oral health outcomes in neighbourhoods and small area geographies through two novel simulation methods-spatial microsimulation and agent-based modelling. Spatial microsimulation is a population synthesis technique, used to combine survey data with Census population totals to create representative individual-level population datasets, allowing for the use of individual-level data previously unavailable at small spatial scales. Agent-based models are computer simulations capable of capturing interactions and feedback mechanisms, both of which are key to understanding health outcomes. Due to these dynamic and interactive processes, the method has an advantage over traditional statistical techniques such as regression analysis, which often isolate elements from each other when testing for statistical significance. This article discusses the current state of spatial analysis within the dental public health field, before reviewing each of the methods, their applications, as well as their advantages and limitations. Directions and topics for future research are also discussed, before addressing the potential to combine the two methods in order to further utilize their advantages.

During the first step, an abstract representation of a village surrounded by a portion of forest was co-designed by directly manipulating the computer interface displaying a spatial grid. Then, knowledge about the live-cycle traits and the behavior of blue duikers was shared through the demonstration of the individual-based population dynamics module of the ABM.

The main features of the model are that it handles time-space constraints, travel time uncertainty, and endogenous trip chaining in one consistent framework.

Modeling opinion exchange and diffusion across landscapes often involves the simulation of large numbers of geographically located individual decision-makers and a massive number of individual-level interactions. This simulation requires substantial computational power. GPU-enabled computing resources provide a massively parallel processing platform based on a fine-grained shared memory paradigm. This massively parallel processing platform holds considerable promise for meeting the computing requirement of agent-based models of spatial problems. In this article, we focus on the parallelization of an agent-based spatial opinion model using CPU technologies. We discussed key algorithms designed for parallel agent-based opinion modeling: including domain decomposition and mutual exclusion. Experiments conducted to examine computing performance show that GPUs provide a computationally efficient alternative to traditional parallel computing architectures and substantially accelerate agent-based models of large-scale opinion exchange among individual decision makers.

Methods: An agent-based disaster simulation model was developed incorporating the principles of dose response, surge response, and psychosocial characteristics superimposed on topographically accurate geographic information system architecture. The modeling scenarios involved passive and active releases of sarin in multiple transportation hubs in a metropolitan city. Parameters evaluated included emergency medical services, hospital surge capacity (including implementation of disaster plan), and behavioral and psychosocial characteristics of the victims. Results: In passive sarin release scenarios of 5 to 15 L, mortality increased nonlinearly from 0.13% to 8.69%, reaching 55.4% with active dispersion, reflecting higher initial doses. Cumulative mortality rates from releases in 1 to 3 major transportation hubs similarly increased nonlinearly as a function of dose and systemic stress. The increase in mortality rate was most pronounced in the 80% to 100% emergency department occupancy range, analogous to the previously observed queuing phenomenon. Effective implementation of hospital disaster plans decreased mortality and injury severity. Decreasing ambulance response time and increasing available responding units reduced mortality among potentially salvageable patients. Adverse psychosocial characteristics (excess worry and low compliance) increased demands on health care resources. Transfer to alternative urban sites was possible.

This article provides an overview of the application of a computational modelling and simulation approach to evaluate SMEs' operational resilience to flooding based on combinations of structural and procedural mitigation measures that may be implemented to improve their premises' resistance to flooding and safeguard their business continuity. The approach integrates flood modelling and simulation with agent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS) within a modelled geographical environment. SMEs are modelled as agents based on findings of semi-structured interviews with SMEs that have experienced flooding or are at risk of flooding. In this paper, the ABMS has been applied to a new case study of the major flood event of 2007 in Tewkesbury. Furthermore, to enable an evaluation of the operational resilience of manufacturing SMEs in terms of the relative effectiveness of flood mitigation measures, a new coefficient based on production loss is introduced. Results indicate structural mitigation measures are more effective than procedural measures. While this result is intuitive, the approach provides a means of evaluating the relative effectiveness of combinations of mitigation measures that SMEs may implement to enhance their operational resilience to flooding.

Lifecycle assessment (LCA) is used as a tool to quantify the GHG emissions from logistics but in the past the majority of LCAs have been steady-state and linear, when in reality, non-linear and temporal aspects (such as weather conditions, seasonal biomass demand, storage capacity, etc.) also have an important role to play. Thus, the objective of this paper was to optimise the environmental sustainability of forest biomass logistics (in terms of GHG emissions) by introducing the dynamic aspects of the supply chain and using the geographical information system (GIS) and agent-based modelling (ABM). The use of the GIS and ABM adds local conditions to the assessment in order to make the study more relevant. In this study, GIS was used to investigate biomass availability, biomass supply points and the road network around a large-scale combined heat and power plant in Naantali, Finland. Furthermore, the temporal aspects of the supply chain (e.g., seasonal biomass demand and storage capacity) were added using ABM to make the assessment dynamic. Based on the outcomes of the GIS and ABM, a gate-to-gate LCA of the forest biomass supply chain was conducted in order to calculate GHG emissions. In addition to the domestic biomass, we added imported biomass from Riga, Latvia to the fuel mixture in order to investigate the effect of sea transportation on overall GHG emissions. Finally, as a sensitivity check, we studied the real-time measurement of biomass quality and its potential impact on overall logistical GHG emissions. According to the results, biomass logistics incurred GHG emissions ranging from 2.72 to 3.46 kg CO2-eq per MWh, depending on the type of biomass and its origin. On the other hand, having 7% imported biomass in the fuel mixture resulted in a 13% increase in GHG emissions. Finally, the real-time monitoring of biomass quality helped save 2% of the GHG emissions from the overall supply chain. The incorporation of the GIS and ABM helped in assessing the environmental impacts of the forest biomass supply chain in local conditions, and the combined approach looks promising for developing LCAs that are inclusive of the temporal aspects of the supply chain for any specific location.",1-Mar,2020,12,5,10.3390/su12051964,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12051964

In Jordan's capital and most populous city, Amman, the pervasive water shortage gave rise to private tanker water operations, which transport groundwater from wells in the vicinity of the city and sell it to urban consumers. These tanker water markets have received little attention in the literature up to date, particularly with regard to their relevance for commercial water users. This paper aims to empirically estimate the water demand of commercial establishments in Amman under public supply rationing and to assess to which extent tanker operations contribute to meeting commercial water needs. Building on a prior simulation model of residential water consumption, the results of three extensive surveys concerned with tanker water markets and various geographic data, we develop a spatial agent-based model of the water consumption behavior of commercial establishments in different sizes. According to our estimation, 35-45% of the overall water volume consumed by the commercial sector stems from tanker operations, depending on the season. We find that the local disparities in access to affordable network water, along with the dispersion of groundwater wells around the city, result in considerable spatial differences in tanker water consumption.

We showcase each in the same fishery agent-based model and rank their performance under various scenarios. While complicated algorithms tend to perform better, too much sophistication lowers performance. Further, while some algorithms perform well under all scenarios, others are optimal only in specific circumstances. It is therefore impossible to produce a single, unequivocal performance ranking even for simple general algorithms.

Models are particularly useful when dealing with complex dynamic systems (as pelagic ecosystems) where data are limited and if various 'what if' scenarios should be tested. The aim of this study was to produce and implement an integrated modelling approach, linking high resolution hydrodynamic models (HDM) of the marine environment with correlative species distribution models (SDM) and agent-based models (ABM), for describing the spatio-temporal distribution and movements of Atlantic mackerel (Scornber scombrus) in the Norwegian Sea. The SDM was fitted with scientific mackerel trawl data as response variables (collected in July and August 2006-2014) and temperature (from the HDM), water depth and time period as predictors of spatial distributions. The SDM was able to produce dynamic predictions of a similar order of magnitude as observed catch per unit effort (CPUE) as well as realistic large-scale distribution patterns, when tested on independent data (not included in the modelling). The ABM was calibrated, with normalized SDM predictions (habitat suitability as a proxy for food availability) and hydrodynamics as input and simulated on a single year (2013) for the period May-October, when the migratory mackerel is present in the study area. A pattern-oriented modelling (POM) approach was used to verify if the model reproduced multiple observed real-world patterns. The ABM produced similar patterns as observed regarding migration timing, growth and large scale geographic distribution. Fine scaled information on mackerel movement and behaviour is limited, which is also reflected in the results. More data and knowledge are therefore required to improve the patterns emerging from fine scaled processes. The potential of the model for assessing an impact of a single seismic survey (mimicking a real survey) was finally evaluated. The exercise allowed estimating the number of affected fish (within 50 km from the sound source) and potential changes in local migrations, with the specific assumed minimum sound pressure thresholds (resulting in a fleeing reaction by the mackerel) set to 165 dB re 1 mu Pa. The model framework was shown to be useful by allowing simulations of impact scenarios in a realistic and dynamic environment. The model can be further updated when data on fine scale movements of mackerel and most importantly when improved data on response behaviour to impacts of sound become available.",10-Nov,2018,387,,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.08.010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.08.010

Inherently spatial school-place allocation rules in many areas have produced a geography of inequality between parents that succeed and fail to get their child into preferred schools based upon where they live. We present an agent-based simulation model developed to investigate the implications of distance-based school-place allocation policies. We show how a simple, abstract model can generate patterns of school popularity, performance and spatial distribution of pupils which are similar to those observed in local education authorities in London, UK. The model represents 'school' and 'parent' agents. Parental 'aspiration' to send their child to the best performing school (as opposed to other criteria) is a primary parent agent attribute in the model. This aspiration attribute is used as a means to constrain the location and movement of parent agents within the modelled environment. Results indicate that these location and movement constraints are needed to generate empirical patterns, and that patterns are generated most closely and consistently when schools agents differ in their ability to increase pupil attainment. Analysis of model output for simulations using these mechanisms shows how parent agents with above-average but not very high aspiration fail to get their child a place at their preferred school more frequently than other parent agents. We highlight the kinds of alternative school-place allocation rules and education system policies the model can be used to investigate.",31-Jan,2014,17,1,10.18564/jasss.2332,http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.2332

Results show that stronger clustering within hospitals or geo-political regions is associated with slower adoption amongst smaller and rural facilities. Results of repeated simulation show how the nature of uptake and competition can contribute to low average levels of recommended care within a system that relies on diffusive adoption.

Despite the scale of informal urbanization, it has received little attention from scholars working in the domains of urban analytics and city science. Towards addressing this gap, we introduce TI-City, an urban growth model designed to predict the locations, legal status and socio-economic status of future residential developments in an African city.

"Burda, Zdzislaw",Modelling Excess Mortality in Covid-19-Like Epidemics,ENTROPY,"We develop an agent-based model to assess the cumulative number of deaths during hypothetical Covid-19-like epidemics for various non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies. The model simulates three interrelated stochastic processes: epidemic spreading, availability of respiratory ventilators and changes in death statistics. We consider local and non-local modes of disease transmission. The first simulates transmission through social contacts in the vicinity of the place of residence while the second through social contacts in public places: schools, hospitals, airports, etc., where many people meet, who live in remote geographic locations. Epidemic spreading is modelled as a discrete-time stochastic process on random geometric networks. We use the Monte-Carlo method in the simulations. The following assumptions are made. The basic reproduction number is R0=2.5 and the infectious period lasts approximately ten days. Infections lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome in about one percent of cases, which are likely to lead to respiratory default and death, unless the patient receives an appropriate medical treatment. The healthcare system capacity is simulated by the availability of respiratory ventilators or intensive care beds. Some parameters of the model, like mortality rates or the number of respiratory ventilators per 100,000 inhabitants, are chosen to simulate the real values for the USA and Poland. In the simulations we compare 'do-nothing' strategy with mitigation strategies based on social distancing and reducing social mixing. We study epidemics in the pre-vacine era, where immunity is obtained only by infection. The model applies only to epidemics for which reinfections are rare and can be neglected. The results of the simulations show that strategies that slow the development of an epidemic too much in the early stages do not significantly reduce the overall number of deaths in the long term, but increase the duration of the epidemic. In particular, a hybrid strategy where lockdown is held for some time and is then completely released, is inefficient.",NOV,2020,22,11,10.3390/e22111236,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e22111236

The mathematical foundation for graph theory, including the measures that are used to describe networks and the theoretical graph types, are introduced. Geospatial applications of networks and graph theory are also presented. Examples of network-based automata models are presented as avenues for future research work in evolving spatial networks as part of GISc and computational geography.",SEP,2020,14,9,10.1111/gec3.12502,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gec3.12502
"Harding, Nathan; Spinney, Richard; Prokopenko, Mikhail",Phase Transitions in Spatial Connectivity during Influenza Pandemics,ENTROPY,"We investigated phase transitions in spatial connectivity during influenza pandemics, relating epidemic thresholds to the formation of clusters defined in terms of average infection. We employed a large-scale agent-based model of influenza spread at a national level: the Australian Census-based Epidemic Model (AceMod). In using the AceMod simulation framework, which leverages the 2016 Australian census data and generates a surrogate population of approximate to 23.4 million agents, we analysed the spread of simulated epidemics across geographical regions defined according to the Australian Statistical Geography Standard. We considered adjacent geographic regions with above average prevalence to be connected, and the resultant spatial connectivity was then analysed at specific time points of the epidemic. Specifically, we focused on the times when the epidemic prevalence peaks, either nationally (first wave) or at a community level (second wave). Using the percolation theory, we quantified the connectivity and identified critical regimes corresponding to abrupt changes in patterns of the spatial distribution of infection. The analysis of criticality is confirmed by computing Fisher Information in a model-independent way. The results suggest that the post-critical phase is characterised by different spatial patterns of infection developed during the first or second waves (distinguishing urban and rural epidemic peaks).",FEB,2020,22,2,10.3390/e22020133,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e22020133

While abiotic factors likely drive some of the variation in species richness, ecological interactions may also contribute. Here, we examine one class of potential contributors to species richness variation that is particularly poorly understood: mutualistic interactions. We aim to elucidate large-scale patterns of diversification mediated by mutualistic interactions using a spatially explicit population-based model. We focus on mutualistic Mullerian mimicry between conspicuous toxic prey species, where convergence in color patterns emerges from predators' learning process. To investigate the effects of Mullerian mimicry on species diversification, we assume that some speciation events stem from shifts in ecological niches, and can also be associated with shift in mimetic color pattern. Through the emergence of spatial mosaics of mimetic color patterns, Mullerian mimicry constrains the geographical distribution of species and allows different species occupying similar ecological niches to exist simultaneously in different regions. Mullerian mimicry and the resulting spatial segregation of mimetic color patterns thus generate more balanced phylogenetic trees and increase overall species diversity. Our study sheds light on complex effects of Mullerian mimicry on ecological, spatial, and phylogenetic diversification.",APR,2017,71,4,10.1111/evo.13182,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/evo.13182

We argue that agent-based simulation provides a complementary method to investigate geographical issues which need not be used in ways that are epistemologically different in kind from some other approaches in contemporary geography. We propose mixed qualitative-simulation methods that iterate back-and-forth between thick' (qualitative) and thin' (simulation) approaches and between the theory and data they produce.

"Vallee, Francois; Luciani, Aurelien; Cox, Murray P.",Reconstructing Demography and Social Behavior During the Neolithic Expansion from Genomic Diversity Across Island Southeast Asia,GENETICS,"Archaeology, linguistics, and increasingly genetics are clarifying how populations moved from mainland Asia, through Island Southeast Asia, and out into the Pacific during the farming revolution. Yet key features of this process remain poorly understood, particularly how social behaviors intersected with demographic drivers to create the patterns of genomic diversity observed across Island Southeast Asia today. Such questions are ripe for computer modeling. Here, we construct an agent-based model to simulate human mobility across Island Southeast Asia from the Neolithic period to the present, with a special focus on interactions between individuals with Asian, Papuan, and mixed Asian-Papuan ancestry. Incorporating key features of the region, including its complex geography (islands and sea), demographic drivers (fecundity and migration), and social behaviors (marriage preferences), the model simultaneously tracks a full suite of genomic markers (autosomes, X chromosome, mitochondrial DNA, and Y chromosome). Using Bayesian inference, model parameters were determined that produce simulations that closely resemble the admixture profiles of 2299 individuals from 84 populations across Island Southeast Asia. The results highlight that greater propensity to migrate and elevated birth rates are related drivers behind the expansion of individuals with Asian ancestry relative to individuals with Papuan ancestry, that offspring preferentially resulted from marriages between Asian women and Papuan men, and that in contrast to current thinking, individuals with Asian ancestry were likely distributed across large parts of western Island Southeast Asia before the Neolithic expansion.",DEC,2016,204,4,10.1534/genetics.116.191379,http://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.116.191379
"Anderson, Taylor; Dragicevic, Suzana",An agent-based modeling approach to represent infestation dynamics of the emerald ash borer beetle,ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,"Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a bottom-up approach capable of operationalizing complex systems. The approach can be used to reproduce the spatio-temporal patterns in ecological processes such as insect infestation by representing individual dynamics and interactions between agents and their environment from which complex behavior emerges. The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis; EAB) is an invasive species native to southeast Asia which has infested and killed millions of ash trees (Fraxinus sp.) across the eastern United States as well as Ontario and Quebec in Canada. Efforts to model the insect's behavior are ongoing, but current models are limited to approaches that do not address the complexity that emerges from the dynamics between individual beetles and their varying spatial environments. The objective of this study is to develop an ABM to represent the interactions of the EAB and the emerging spatio-temporal pattern of the insect spread. The model is implemented on real datasets from the Town of Oakville, Ontario, Canada from 2008 to 2010. Tree inventory and land use data acquired from the Town of Oakville were used to represent the spatial environment of the EAB agents. The EAB interactions are implemented in the model as subroutines, each representing a stage in the EAB life cycle using a temporal resolution of one day. Model verification was performed based on the literature documenting the life cycle processes of the EAB to represent EAB behavior. The model is calibrated using the rate of spread observed in the Town of Oakville from 2008 to 2009 and is validated using datasets delimiting the spatial extent and severity of EAB infestation in 2009. When comparing simulated and observed data, there is a 72% agreement for the locations of the infestation. This indicates that the developed ABM approach offers a model able to capture the complex behavior of EAB where both the spatial extent and severity of infestation are simulated realistically. The model generates insights about the underlying processes governing EAB behavior, highlights areas of uncertainty in modeling the complex spatio-temporal patterns of EAB infestation, and is a useful tool for forest and pest management.

Farmland is a complex and self-adaptive system that couples human and natural systems, and natural and social factors that are related to its changing process need to be considered when modeling farmland changing processes. This paper uses Qianjingou Town in the Inner Mongolian farming-pastoral zone as a study area. From the perspective of the relationship between household livelihood and farmland use, this study establishes the process mechanism of farmland use change based on questionnaire data, and constructs a multi-agent simulation model of farmland use change using the Eclipse and Repast toolbox. Through simulating the relationship between natural factors (including geographical location) and household behavior, this paper systematically simulates household farmland abandonment and rent behaviors, and accurately describes the dynamic interactions between household livelihoods and the factors related to farmland use change. These factors include natural factors (net primary productivity, road accessibility, slope and relief amplitude) and social factors (household family structures, economic development and government policies). Ultimately, this study scientifically predicts the future farmland use change trend in the next 30 years. The simulation results show that the number of abandoned and sublet farmland plots has a gradually increasing trend, and the number of non-farming households and pure-outworking households has a remarkable increasing trend, whereas the number of part-farming households and pure-farming households has a decreasing trend. Household livelihood sustainability in the study area is confronted with increasing pressure, and household non-farm employment has an increasing trend, while regional appropriate-scale agricultural management is maintained. The research results establish the theoretical foundation and a basic method for developing sustainable farmland use management that can meet the willingness of households and guarantee grain and ecological security.",NOV,2015,7,11,10.3390/su71114802,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su71114802
"Bose, Abhijit; Shin, Kang G.",Agent-based modeling of malware dynamics in heterogeneous environments,SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS,"The increasing convergence of power-law networks such as social networking and peer-to-peer applications, web-delivered applications, and mobile platforms makes today's users highly vulnerable to entirely new generations of malware that exploit vulnerabilities in web applications and mobile platforms for new infections, while using the power-law connectivity for finding new victims. The traditional epidemic models based on assumptions of homogeneity, average-degree distributions, and perfect-mixing are inadequate to model this type of malware propagation. In this paper, we study four aspects crucial to modeling malware propagation: application-level interactions among users of such networks, local network structure, user mobility, and network coordination of malware such as botnets. Since closed-form solutions of malware propagation considering these aspects are difficult to obtain, we describe an open-source, flexible agent-based emulation framework that can be used by malware researchers for studying today's complex malware. The framework, called Agent-Based Malware Modeling (AMM), allows different applications, network structure, network coordination, and user mobility in either a geographic or a logical domain to study various infection and propagation scenarios. In addition to traditional worms and viruses, the framework also allows modeling network coordination of malware such as botnets. The majority of the parameters used in the framework can be derived from real-life network traces collected from a network, and therefore, represent realistic malware propagation and infection scenarios. As representative examples, we examine two well-known malware spreading mechanisms: (i) a malicious virus such as Cabir spreading among the subscribers of a cellular network using Bluetooth and (ii) a hybrid worm that exploit email and file-sharing to infect users of a social network. In both cases, we identify the parameters most important to the spread of the epidemic based upon our extensive simulation results.

The GIS calculates the average harvested patch size, number of patches, and total harvested area as measures of emergent patterns resulting from agent actions. The results from the agent-based GIS model reveal that good economic conditions lead to few but large harvested patches, while deteriorating conditions will see more patches of smaller size if forest companies have access to high-quality timber.

The framework features an agent-based model that simulates Mean Radiant Temperature as a function of tree position using a mathematical model based on a bivariate gaussian distribution. Environmental conditions are sensed by Human agents which generates comfort levels and affects walking decisions. To optimize tree distribution, a Genetic Algorithm is used to find the tree distribution that generates maximum walking frequency. The simulation results indicate that spacing between trees, direction of neighboring buildings, and Building Shadow Exposure (BSE) affect walking frequency.

Despite various government regulations to boost PV deployment, RPV diffusion in Singapore has been slow, accounting for less than 4% of installed PV capacity by 2021. Investment volatility and uncertainty impede RPV deployment as it significantly affects consumers' adoption decisions. RPV diffusion analysis helps researchers develop deployment strategies by considering and modelling the RPV diffusion process and its major influencing factors. However, the existing works neglect heterogenous consumers' behaviours to address investment volatility in the network. Consumer behaviours, including spontaneous adoption decisions and interpersonal communications, are essential in determining RPV adoption and diffusion. This study constructed a Real Options Analysis supported Agent-Based Diffusion Model (ROA-ABDM) to investigate the RPV diffusion in Singapore by applying the bottom-up simulation modelling approach. ROA is used in simulation based RPV diffusion analysis to offer consumers flexible options to address investment volatility by calculating the option's value. Afterward, the Agent-based diffusion model is developed, calibrated, and validated with RPV historical diffusion data in Singapore. From the what-if' analysis using the developed model, this study identifies that the optimal RPV subsidy intensity is 30-40% and reveals that RPV diffusion is more effective in a tight-knit network and sensitive to investment volatility. Based on the findings, this study proposes two policy suggestions, including stage-based dynamic policy and trusted-network oriented campaigns.

While individual models are well defined and the modeling techniques are well understood by practitioners, there is little deliberate choice made as to the type of model to be used, with modelers using techniques that are well accepted in the field, sometimes with little thought as to whether alternative modeling techniques could or should be used. In this article, we divide modeling techniques for spatial transmission into four main categories: population-level models, where a macro-level estimate of the infected population is required; cellular models, where the transmission takes place between connected domains, but is restricted to a fixed topology of neighboring cells; network models, where host-to-host transmission routes are modeled, either as planar spatial graphs or where shortcuts can take place as in social networks; and, finally, agent-based models that model the local transmission between agents, either as host-to-host geographical contacts, or by modeling the movement of the disease vector, with dynamic movement of hosts and vectors possible, on a Euclidian space or a more complex space deformed by the existence of information about the topology of the landscape. We summarize these techniques by introducing a taxonomy classifying these modeling approaches.

We investigated how chickenpox vaccination in Alberta impacts the incidence and age-distribution of shingles over 75 years post-vaccination, taking into consideration a variety of plausible theories of waning and boosting of immunity. Methods: We developed an agent-based model representing VZV disease, transmission, vaccination states and coverage, waning and boosting of immunity in a stylized geographic area, utilizing a distance-based network. We derived parameters from literature, including modeling, epidemiological, and immunology studies. We calibrated our model to the age-specific incidence of shingles and chickenpox prior to vaccination to derive optimal combinations of duration of boosting (DoB) and waning of immunity. We conducted paired simulations with and without implementing chickenpox vaccination. We computed the count and cumulative incidence rate of shingles cases at 10, 25, 50, and 75 years intervals, following introduction of vaccination, and compared the difference between runs with vaccination and without vaccination using the Mann-Whitney U-test to determine statistical significance. We carried out sensitivity analyses by increasing and lowering vaccination coverage and removing biological effect of boosting. Results: Chickenpox vaccination led to a decrease in chickenpox cases. The cumulative incidence of chickenpox had dropped from 1,254 cases per 100,000 person-years pre chickenpox vaccination to 193 cases per 100,000 person-years 10 years after the vaccine implementation. We observed an increase in the all-ages shingles cumulative incidence at 10 and 25 years post chickenpox vaccination and mixed cumulative incidence change at 50 and 75 years post-vaccination. The magnitude of change was sensitive to DoB and ranged from an increase of 22-100 per 100,000 person-years at 10 years post-vaccination for two and seven years of boosting respectively (p < 0.001). At 75 years post-vaccination, cumulative incidence ranged from a decline of 70 to an increase of 71 per 100,000 person-years for two and seven years of boosting respectively (p < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses had a minimal impact on our inferences except for removing the effect of boosting. Discussion: Our model demonstrates that over the longer time period, there will be a reduction in shingles incidence driven by the depletion of the source of shingles reactivation; however in the short to medium term some age cohorts may experience an increase in shingles incidence. Our model offers a platform to further explore the relationship between chickenpox and shingles, including analyzing the impact of different chickenpox vaccination schedules and cost-effectiveness studies.",20-Jun,2018,6,,10.7717/peerj.5012,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.5012
"Hoelzchen, Ericson; Hertler, Christine; Timm, Ingo; Lorig, Fabian",Evaluation of Out of Africa hypotheses by means of agent-based modeling,QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL,"According to the Out of Africa theory early hominins originated in Africa subsequently dispersing into Eurasia. At least two dispersal events are documented, during which Pleistocene hominins left the African continent. Out of Africa 1 refers to the early hominin dispersal prior to Homo sapiens (e.g. Homo erectus/ergaster) while Out of Africa 2 deals with the dispersal of H. sapiens. Many hypotheses try to explain why early hominins dispersed beyond the African continent. Suggested causes include factors such as climate, geography, vegetation, demography, competition, ecology and cognition. However, no attempt has been made yet to model the hypotheses' mechanisms explicitly in order to compare them on a quantitative scale. We therefore explore the potential of agent-based modeling. An agent-based model consists of the acting entities, the so-called agents, an environment and rules of interaction among them. We analyzed the most common Out of Africa hypotheses and systematically formalized them by aid of an agent-based modeling framework. Our results show that the most common Out of Africa hypotheses can be attributed to at least four different scenarios. We refer to the scenarios as environmental, demographic, resource driven, ecology and cognition based scenarios. Our study provides a framework that helps designing agent-based models with respect to the dispersal of early hominins out of the African continent. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

"Hiesl, Patrick; Waring, Timothy M.; Benjamin, Jeffrey G.",The effect of hardwood component on grapple skidder and stroke delimber idle time and productivity - An agent based model,COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE,"The forest industry is a capital intensive business and therefore high efficiency in management and forest operations is a must. Maine has millions of acres of forest stands with tree diameters smaller than 30 cm. The harvest productivity in such stands is low compared to stands with larger diameter trees. A recent harvest productivity study in Maine identified operational constraints for whole tree harvest systems, but efforts to improve active operations would be expensive and time consuming. A common practice to reduce costs and time consumption is to develop simulation models and implement new ideas within them. We developed a production efficiency model that leverages an agent-based modeling approach. The model is based on the interaction of two common forest machines (grapple skidder and stroke delimber) and incorporates empirical cycle time estimates from research in Maine. Three scenarios have been developed to investigate baseline conditions, and two GPS and GIS aided communication improvements. The goal of this paper is to document a new agent based model and to investigate the effect of hardwood component on machine idle time and productivity. Results showed that system productivity was affected by skidding distance, bunch spacing, and removal intensity. An increase in hardwood component led to a decrease in stroke delimber idle time but did not affect grapple skidder idle time. Further, hardwood component did not affect system productivity, and none of the three single-skidder scenarios tested performed any better than another. We validated the model by conducting a sensitivity analysis to confirm previous research results. The modeled waiting times are well within the range of observed values and therefore suggest that this model is accurate and well calibrated. Our conclusions are that when operating under average harvesting conditions there is no loss in productivity due to a change in hardwood component and that a stroke delimber idle time of 40% or more is unavoidable unless the stroke delimber can work independently. Future applications of this model may target specific production forestry conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper demonstrates how high performance computing technologies, namely General-Purpose Computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU), and commercial Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can be applied to develop a national scale, agent-based simulation of an incursion of Old World Screwworm fly COWS fly) into the Australian mainland. The development of this simulation model leverages the combination of massively data-parallel processing capabilities supported by NVidia's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and the advanced spatial visualisation capabilities of GIS. These technologies have enabled the implementation of an individual-based, stochastic lifecycle and dispersal algorithm for the OWS fly invasion. The simulation model draws upon a wide range of biological data as input to stochastically determine the reproduction and survival of the OWS fly through the different stages of its lifecycle and dispersal of gravid females. Through this model, a highly efficient computational platform has been developed for studying the effectiveness' of control and mitigation strategies and their associated economic impact on livestock industries can be materialised.

Step 1: The Musical Chairs Model,JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL METHOD AND THEORY,"Herding and farming coexisted in Central Asia for several thousand years as main options of preindustrial economic production. The relationship between people practicing different variants of these modes of subsistence is known to have been dynamic. Among the many possible explanations, we explore this dynamic by modeling mechanisms that connect aggregate decisions to land use patterns. Within the framework of the SimulPast project, we show here the results from step 1 of our modeling program: the Musical Chairs Model. This abstract agent-based model describes a mechanism of competition for land use between farming and herding. The aim is the exploration of how mobility, intensity, and interdependence of activities can influence land use pattern. After performing a set of experiments within the framework of this model, we compare the implications of each condition for the corroboration of specific land use patterns. Some historical and archaeological implications are also discussed. We suggest that the overall extension of farming in oases can be explained by the competition for land use between farming and herding, assuming that it develops with little or no interference of climatic, geographical, and historical contingencies.",JUN,2014,21,2,10.1007/s10816-013-9197-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10816-013-9197-0

During the validation process, model performance and accuracy assessment depend mostly on pixel-by-pixel comparisons. However, in urban land-use planning problems the use of vector spatial data to develop ABMs is becoming more necessary. Hence, improved and robust validation approaches are required for vector-based ABMs. This study presents a novel validation approach for an ABM using vector-based geographic information system and Bayesian networks. The approach creates a unique-polygons map and an object-oriented database. Three indicator variables are calculated to assess the probability of agreement. The indicator variables are nodes in a Bayesian network that is used to evaluate the final agreement of each unique polygon. Further, an index of overall agreement is calculated. The approach was applied to a simulation outcome map generated by an existing Bayesian network-based agent-system (BNAS) model. The BNAS model simulation of land-use change for the year 2001 was compared with the actual land-use change for the same year using the proposed validation approach. The results obtained indicate that significant agreement between the maps was achieved. The approach is well suited for validating vector-based ABMs and can be used as an aid in model designs for improved model performance.",SEP,2009,36,5,10.1068/b34143t,http://dx.doi.org/10.1068/b34143t

It can support better land management and decision-making for increasing the yield of food production to fulfill the food needs in a specific area. However, modeling land-use change involves the complexity of human drivers and natural or environmental constraints. This study develops an agent-based model (ABM) for land use transitions using critical indicators that contribute to food deserts. The model's performance was evaluated using Guilford County, North Carolina, as a case study. The modeling inputs include land covers, climate variability (rainfall and temperature), soil quality, land-use-related policies, and population growth. Studying the interrelationships between these factors can improve the development of effective land-use policies and help responsible agencies and policymakers plan accordingly to improve food security. The agent-based model illustrates how and when individuals or communities could make specific land-cover transitions to fulfill the community's food needs.

"Kim, Sojung; Kim, Sumin",Hybrid simulation framework for the production management of an ethanol biorefinery,RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS,"To make ethanol cost-competitive with gasoline, it is critical to devise a cost-effective production plan for ethanol refineries. However, unlike with petroleum refineries, the managers of the corn-based ethanol refineries are faced with multiple challenges. Particularly, the refineries should have a consistent production rate despite the uncertain yield of feedstock production that results from a dynamic environment, including climate change. In this study, a hybrid simulation framework was developed for operating biofuel refineries. The framework consisted of two major simulation platforms: (1) Agricultural Land Management Alternative with Numerical Assessment Criteria (ALMANAC) for yield estimation of feedstock considering dynamic environmental factors and (2) simulation-based optimization with agent-based simulation (ABS) to identify the optimal production plan in terms of operational cost based on yield and relevant parameters given by ALMANAC. In ABS, eight major operations (e.g., milling, cooking, liquefaction, and fermentation) of a refinery were modeled via AnyLogic (R) ABS software to accurately compute operational costs. We used a geographic information system (GIS) map to compute transportation costs between feedstock farms, refineries, and consumers' facilities. The proposed framework was demonstrated using real data of feedstock and ethanol production in Tazewell County, Illinois, U. S. The experiments identified that the ethanol production planning without considering feedstock loss could cause overproduction at a refinery. The daily overproduction costs with 28% dry matter and 45% dry matter are 23.56% and 14.07% of their total operational costs, respectively.

Perceptions of, and attitudes to, other UGS users have been theorised as a determinant of visiting. In the absence of data on these factors, we created a spatial agent-based model (ABM) of four cities in Scotland to investigate intra-and inter-city inequalities in UGS visiting. The ABM focused on the plausibility of a 'social integration hypothesis' whereby the primary factor in decisions to visit UGS is an assessment of who else is likely to be using the space. The model identified the conditions under which this mechanism was sufficient to reproduce the observed inequalities. The addition of environmental factors, such as neighbourhood walkability and green space quality, increased the ability of the model to reproduce observed phenomena.

The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarette) offers potential to facilitate cigarette smoking cessation, yet potentially increases risk of cigarette smoking initiation. This relationship has been primarily modeled in mathematical ways that often do not represent real-world complexities, which could inform decisions regarding local prevention programs or policies. Aims. To develop a model of cigarette and e-cigarette use that combines current research on tobacco use and incorporates real-world geographic and demographic data. Method. We used a platform for developing agent-based models with demographic information representative of the population in Pennsylvania. We developed three models of cigarette and e-cigarette use. The primary outcome for each was the total number of users for cigarette, e-cigarette, and total nicotine. The first model applied current cigarette and e-cigarette data, the second tested the effect of implementing a program of e-cigarette education and policies, and the third considered a social contagion factor, where local schools functioned as a transmission vector. Results. The baseline and social contagion models found an overall decline in cigarette use but an increase in e-cigarette and total nicotine use. The education/policies model had declines in all categories. Sensitivity analysis suggested the importance of nuanced e-cigarette/cigarette interactions when modeling tobacco use. Discussion. Public health campaigns that focus on reducing youth e-cigarette usage can have a large effect. Social contagion should be strongly considered when studying e-cigarette spread. Conclusion.

In this article, we apply an agent-based simulation model of the human-environment system to better understand possible causes of these dynamics. Therefore, we formulate a generic quantitative model of land use and calorie supply in Neolithic wetland sites ca. 4300-3700 bc. Archaeological, geographical and palaeoenvironmental data together with information from an agronomic crop yield model (MONICA) are used in an agent-based simulation of Neolithic land use (WELASSIMO model). We fit the generic model to specific conditions at six archaeological sites and their surrounding environments, using local data. In our simulations, annual crop yields fluctuate markedly around a long term mean which starts to decrease after a few years of crop production. Crop plants supply 60-90% of the annual calorie demand. As sources of readily available non-crop calories are needed to compensate potential low crop yields, we argue that Corylus avellana (hazelnuts) were especially important to provide these extra calories; the simulated importance of non-crop calories is 10-40%. Records of human-induced fires are interpreted as being indicative of a strategy to generally open up the woodland canopy and promote the growth of light-demanding hazel. The extent of the different land use methods is quantified and visualized in tiles of 8 km(2) around the six study sites.

"Orsi, Francesco",Centrally located yet close to nature: A prescriptive agent-based model for urban design,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,"A common dilemma for planners is how to design urban settlements that give people easy access to a center and nature. Difficulties arise because each households access to such elements is a function of other households' location and the set of potential arrangements is constrained by the households' degree of acceptance of different density levels. This paper suggests the ideal arrangement of built-up and green areas may be identified by simulating in an agent-based model (ABM) the interactions of virtual households that try to find the best residential location based on their preferences towards distance from the center, proximity to green space and density. Simulations showed that the ABM can, iteration after iteration, develop progressively better configurations and eventually get to an equilibrium if households' locational choice is driven not only by the maximization of individual utility, but also the preservation of the neighbors' well-being. Model's outputs suggest that compact settlements with an even distribution of green spaces offer the greatest benefits to their inhabitants, and that larger green areas are to be preferred when the population is less sensitive to density and/or the travel to the center is faster along some directions. Application of a rent formation model on the configurations generated by the ABM shows that these are relatively equitable, as lower income households could afford at least half of all locations. Future improvements can turn this model into a suitable tool for designing new settlements, guiding the densification of existing settlements or defining zoning regulations.",JAN,2019,73,,10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.10.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.10.001

Recent technological advances have made it easy for archaeologists to rely on Geographic Information Systems' least-cost path tools to identify the single easiest path to move between two points set in a realistically rugged landscape; however, least-cost path tools work on the assumption that the whole world is perfectly known, which does not represent human mobility accurately in all cases. Here, we present an agent based least-cost path (AB-LCP) model, which does not make the assumption of complete landscape knowledge, and allows creating multiple anisotropic least-cost paths that take the traveler's local perspective and incomplete knowledge into consideration. We demonstrate the model's potential through a case study of the geographical distribution of Cantabrian (Spain) Lower Magdalenian engraved scapulae, which provides an interesting extension to current understanding of Magdalenian mobility, showcasing the flexibility and potential of this new LCP tool to study archaeological landscapes. The results of our study suggest that the studied engraved scapulae may have been created at El Castillo, and then brought to Altamira for transmission to other sites. The results show that El Castillo was strategically located on a bottleneck for coastal-to-plain mobility, whereas Altamira was located along social paths connecting other contemporaneous sites. This supports the already-accepted notion that both sites may have served for Upper Paleolithic population aggregation. However, our research builds on this idea by explaining why these two sites would have become so important. We suggest that Altamira was strategically placed near the boundary of inter-regional groups, thus taking the role as an aggregation site for unrelated populations, whereas El Castillo would have been used by the intra-regional group population to congregate during the summer and take advantage of the local mosaic of resources.",NOV,2018,99,,10.1016/j.jas.2018.08.014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2018.08.014

Many cities in the Free State of Saxony, Germany, were strongly hit by several floods in the last years and are additionally challenged by demographic change, with an ageing society and out-migration leading to population shrinkage in many parts of Saxony. Disaster management, which is mostly volunteer-based in Germany, is particularly affected by this change, leading to a loss of members. We propose an agent-based simulation model that acts as a virtual lab to explore the impact of various changes on disaster management performance. Using different scenarios we examine the impact of changes in personal resources of DMOs, their access to operation relevant information, flood characteristics as well as differences between geographic regions.

In ABSHM-GIS, a bottom-up research methodology coupled with farmers' behavioral economics and government policies is used to examine the factors influencing farmers' cropping structure and the impact of cropping decisions on farmers' income and the spatial and temporal distributions of water resources. In this study, ABSHM-GIS was applied in the context of planting structure and crop subsidy policy in Qira oasis, Xinjiang, China as a case study area. Results showed that government intervention in cropping structure was effective in reducing water use for agricultural irrigation (18-30 million m3/year) relative to farmer intervention, but it also reduced farmer returns (17,850-25,860 yuan/ha). During the period of agricultural irrigation, regulating the increase in the lower residual volume of irrigation gates 2-4 in the range of 666-869 m3/day and that of irrigation gates 5-9 in the range of 211-342 m3/day could effectively ensure the even spatial distribution of surface water and groundwater.

In Brussels, freight transport generates euro61,604 of air pollution health costs daily. Research has shown that dynamic spatiotemporal modeling of both emission sources and exposed people (using mobile phone data) renders more accurate impact results when analyzed in microenvironments. However, mobile data underrepresent population segments that are more sensitive to the effects of air pollution, such as toddlers, children and elderly individuals. This paper examined the link between vulnerable people aged 0-3, 3-18 and >65 years and freight transport-related air pollution concentrations in the BrusselsCapital Region (BCR). To this end, dynamic tailpipe emissions and their spatiotemporal dispersion were calculated using output from the Transport Agent-Based Model (TRABAM) on a daily basis. Population densities were calculated as a function of the residences' occupancy rate and school/class size and opening hours. The effects of exposure were then evaluated using age- and sex-differentiated exposure-response functions and monetized using local hospital cost factors. Data were compiled for 2021. A strong overlap between people's presence at the institutions' locations was noticed with a peak in (freight) transportation movements in the city.

While these vulnerable groups made up 25.34% of the total BCR population, they incurred 60% [56.03%-65.01%] of the engendered transportation air pollution costs. The results were then geographically analyzed to identify 465 traffic-related air pollution hotspots across the territory, which accounted for euro36,000 [euro33,677.85-euro39,101.31] of total costs.

While synthetic population datasets are now available for several countries, there is no open-source synthetic population for Canada. We propose an open-source synthetic population of individuals and households at a fine geographical level for Canada for the years 2021, 2023 and 2030. Based on 2016 census data and population projections, the synthetic individuals have detailed socio-demographic attributes, including age, sex, income, education level, employment status and geographic locations, and are related into households. A comparison of the 2021 synthetic population with 2021 census data over various geographical areas validates the reliability of the synthetic dataset.

However, ABMS still faces diverse challenges such as modelling more representative agents or improving computational efficiency. Research shows that machine learning (ML) techniques, when used in ABMS can address such challenges. Yet, the ABMS literature is still marginally leveraging the bene-fits of ML. One reason is the vastness of the ML domain, which makes it difficult to choose the appropriate ML technique to overcome a specific modelling challenge. This paper aims to bring ML more within reach of the ABMS community. We first conduct a structured literature review to investigate how the ABMS process uses ML techniques. We focus specifically on articles where ML is applied for the structural specifications of models such as agent decision-making and behaviour, rather than just for analysing output data. Given that modelling challenges are mainly linked to the purpose a model aims to serve (e.g., behavioural accuracy is required for predictive models), we frame our analysis within different modelling purposes. Our results show that Reinforce-ment Learning algorithms may increase the accuracy of behavioural modelling. Moreover, Decision Trees, and Bayesian Networks are common techniques for data pre-processing of agent behaviour. Based on the literature review results, we propose guidelines for purposefully integrating ML in ABMS. We conclude that ML techniques are specifically fit for currently underrepresented modelling purposes of social learning and illustration; they can be used in a transparent and interpretable manner.",31-Jan,2023,26,1,10.18564/jasss.5016,http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.5016

Given their density and available infrastructure, refugee and internally displaced person (IDP) settlements can be particularly susceptible to disease spread. In this paper we present an agent-based modeling approach to simulating the spread of disease in refugee and IDP settlements under various non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies. The model, based on the June open-source framework, is informed by data on geography, demographics, comorbidities, physical infrastructure and other parameters obtained from real-world observations and previous literature. The development and testing of this approach focuses on the Cox's Bazar refugee settlement in Bangladesh, although our model is designed to be generalizable to other informal settings. Our findings suggest the encouraging self-isolation at home of mild to severe symptomatic patients, as opposed to the isolation of all positive cases in purpose-built isolation and treatment centers, does not increase the risk of secondary infection meaning the centers can be used to provide hospital support to the most intense cases of COVID-19. Secondly we find that mask wearing in all indoor communal areas can be effective at dampening viral spread, even with low mask efficacy and compliance rates. Finally, we model the effects of reopening learning centers in the settlement under various mitigation strategies. For example, a combination of mask wearing in the classroom, halving attendance regularity to enable physical distancing, and better ventilation can almost completely mitigate the increased risk of infection which keeping the learning centers open may cause. These modeling efforts are being incorporated into decision making processes to inform future planning, and further exercises should be carried out in similar geographies to help protect those most vulnerable. Author summary The spread of infectious diseases presents many challenges to healthcare systems and infrastructures across the world. Given their density and available infrastructure, refugee and internally displaced person (IDP) settlements can be particularly susceptible to the dangers of disease spread. This study seeks to understand how COVID-19 spreads in settlements, focusing on the Cox's Bazar refugee settlement in Bangladesh. Our model simulates the movements and interactions of each individual in the settlement, incorporating information about family structures and demographic attributes, to understand how COVID-19 might spread under various intervention strategies. Our analysis suggests that mask wearing in indoor locations can have a significant effect on disease spread, even when wearing reusable cotton masks, which the people in the settlement can make themselves. We also look at different ways to treat individuals who only have milder symptoms and don't yet require hospitalisation, as well as various scenarios which might allow for the safe reopening of schools in the settlement. With almost 80 million forcibly displaced people in the world, we hope that this work will inspire more modeling groups to focus on these vulnerable populations, which have been traditionally under-served by such efforts, to ensure no one is left behind.",OCT,2021,17,10,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009360,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009360

This study aimed to analyze the spatial characteristics of human infection with the H7N9 virus in China and assess the risk areas of the epidemic. Methods: Using kernel density estimation, standard deviation ellipse analysis, spatial and temporal scanning cluster analysis, and Pearson correlation analysis, the spatial characteristics and possible risk factors of the epidemic were studied. Meteorological factors, time (month), and environmental factors were combined to establish an epidemic risk assessment proxy model to assess the risk range of an epidemic. Results: The epidemic situation was significantly correlated with atmospheric pressure, temperature, and daily precipitation (P < 0.05), and there were six temporal and spatial clusters. The fitting accuracy of the epidemic risk assessment agent-based model for lower-risk, low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk was 0.795, 0.672, 0.853, 0.825, respectively. Conclusions: This H7N9 epidemic was found to have more outbreaks in winter and spring. It gradually spread to the inland areas of China. This model reflects the risk areas of human infection with the H7N9 virus. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

We assert that reallocation of ideas among cities is a source of improved allocation of resources. We propose a closed economy, agent-based model that is in constant flux. It is populated by autonomous agents that compete and adjust constantly their behavior in reaction to the conditions they perceive. The economy is a dynamic, self-organizing system. We focus on the intensity of globalization as the critical economic process that explains differences in convergence and divergence in the system. The means by which the extent of globalization affects the long-run performance of economies is the geographic reach of new ideas and their conversion into innovations. The question that plays out in our model is the relative influence of globalization and the localized entrepreneurial ecology on innovation. When the globalization is weak, new firms are limited by the market value of their own city. As the globalization strengthens, more and more new firms belong to the global playground. We demonstrate that in line with empirical literature, the gross domestic product of our urban system increases greatly with the increase in globalization level.",MAY,2021,44,3月4日,10.1177/0160017620946095,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0160017620946095

Pakistan has been working over the past few decades to reduce the risk factor of disasters by using different disaster management approaches. However, these efforts are in an early stage. Although lack of planning and unchecked urbanization are the main hurdles, insufficient resources in terms of technology is also a major contributing factor that impedes achieving desired results. In this paper, we are proposing ABM and simulation of approaches using geographical information system (GIS) maps for disaster management in the urban locality of Pakistan. The conceptual model was implemented for analysis of resource allocation (RA) of first response units (ambulances, fire brigade, etc.). In the proposed model, we used two allocation algorithms; high severity level (HSL) and first come first serve (FCFS). These algorithms were simulated in NetLogo by creating a hypothetical disaster scenario in Rawalpindi city. In our experiments, the design was based on demand, resource agents, and their allocation behavior for disaster management.

In multi-agent simulations of virtual economies, it is important to schedule a large number of agents across the cities involved, in order to establish a functional supply chain network for industrial production. This study describes an experimental evaluation of path planning approaches in the field of multi-agent modelling and simulation, applied to a large-scale setting. The experimental comparison is based on a model in which agents represent economic entities and can participate in mutual interactions. For the purposes of experiment, the model is scaled to various degrees of complexity in terms of the numbers of agents and transportation nodes. Various numbers of agents are used to explore the way in which the model's complexity influences the runtime of the path-planning task. The results indicate that there are significant differences between the runtime performances associated with single approaches, for differing levels of system complexity and model sizes. The study reveals that the appropriate sharing of shortest path information can significantly improve path-planning activities. Hence, this work extends current research in the field of path-planning for multi-agent simulations by conducting an experimental performance analysis of five distinct path-planning approaches and a statistical evaluation of the results. This statistical evaluation contrasts with performance analyses conducted on the basis of 'Big O' notation for algorithmic complexity, which describes the limiting behaviour of the algorithm and gives only a rough performance estimate.

"Naqvi, Asjad",Deep Impact: Geo-Simulations as a Policy Toolkit for Natural Disasters,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,"Adverse post-natural disaster outcomes in low-income regions, like elevated internal migration levels and low consumption levels, are the result of market failures, poor mechanisms for stabilizing income, and missing insurance markets, which force the affected population to respond, and adapt to the shock they face. In a spatial environment, with multiple locations with independent but interconnected markets, these transitions quickly become complex and highly non-linear due to the feedback loops between the micro individual-level decisions and the meso location-wise market decisions. To capture these continuously evolving micro meso interactions, this paper presents a spatially explicit bottom-up agent-based model to analyze natural disaster-like shocks to low-income regions. The aim of the model is to temporally and spatially track how population distributions, income, and consumption levels evolve, in order to identify low-income workers that are food insecure. The model is applied to the 2005 earthquake in northern Pakistan, which faced catastrophic losses and high levels of displacement in a short time span, and with market disruptions, resulted in high levels of food insecurity. The model is calibrated to pre-crisis trends, and shocked using distance-based output and labor loss functions to replicate the earthquake impact. Model results show, how various factors like existing income and saving levels, distance from the fault line, and connectivity to other locations, can give insights into the spatial and temporal emergence of vulnerabilities. The simulation framework presented here, leaps beyond existing modeling efforts, which usually deals with macro long-term loss estimates, and allows policy makers to come up with informed short-term policies in an environment where data is non-existent, policy response is time dependent, and resources are limited.

Feedback from an experimental trial in the city of Besancon, France",PROGRESS IN PLANNING,"In this paper, we present an experimental trial involving the use of a complex spatial simulation platform to support a planning decision process in the city of Besancon (eastern France). In medium-sized towns across France, households with children are leaving to settle in periurban areas, and Besancon is no exception. Under those circumstances, the political objective of the Besancon City authority is to keep middle- and high-income households with children within the city. The simulation platform MobiSim was used in this context to explore the possible outcomes of spatial planning policies, set by both the Greater Besancon authority (Besancon and the surrounding periurban communities) and the city of Besancon, on residential migrations over a 20 year period. MobiSim integrates several models representing demographic, social, economic, and spatial processes. Modelled entities are individuals and dwellings. Rules determine how individuals form households. Other rules locate dwellings in buildings. The experimental trial began in October 2012. It involved two researchers in geography and planning from the University of Franche-Comte (Besancon, France) and two planning practitioners working in Besancon city council's planning service: the Department of Planning, Projects and Forward Planning. The first stage of the trial was the collective definition and simulation of a baseline position simply extending existing trends from 2010 to 2030: the 'Business as usual' scenario. The second stage was a collective reflection on possible modifications to some of the variables and parameters of this scenario in order to simulate a pro-active policy of housing construction in the medium term. Under the conditions represented in the model, the 'Pro-active housing construction' scenario in Besancon allows an overall reduction of migration flows from Besangon to the surrounding periurban areas. More single parent families choose to reside in Besancon during the whole simulation time. Couples with children, however, choose preferentially to reside in Besancon until 2022 only. At this date, the controlled housing developments become less numerous. This experimental trial gave the researchers and the planning actors involved in it the occasion to exchange their scientific knowledge and their empirical knowledge. The simulation of the 'Business as usual' scenario was, as it were, a means to thoroughly explore one possible future. This then led the group to discuss possible planning actions designed to reduce migration flows of households with children out of Besancon into periurban areas. The trial also shows some limitations: it highlights that this kind of PSS makes the planning actors heavily dependent on the expertise of the researchers for every stage of the process.

Agents were modeled as socially intelligent actors who communicate using a system of symbols. The goal of the simulation was for agents to reach consensus about which situations in their regional environment to change and which ones not to change as part of a geodesign process for improving water quality in the greater Puget Sound region. As opposed to studying self-organizing behavior at the scale of a local 'commons', our interest was in how online technology supports the self-organizing behavior of agents distributed over a wide regional area, like a watershed or river basin. Geographically-distributed agents interacted through an online platform similar to that used in online field experiments with actual human subjects. We used a factorial research design to vary three interdependent factors each with three different levels. The three factors included 1) the social and geographic distribution of agents (local, regional, international levels), 2) abundance of agents (low, medium, high levels), and 3) diversity of preconceptions (blank slate, clone, social actor levels). We expected that increasing the social and geographic distribution of agents and the diversity of their preconceptions would have a significant impact on agent consensus about which situations to change and which ones not to change. However, our expectations were not met by our findings, which we trace all the way back to our conceptual model and a theoretical gap in sustainability science. The theory of self-organizing resource users does not specify how a group of social actors' preconceptions about a situation is interdependent with their social and geographic orientation to that situation. We discuss the results of the experiment and conclude with prospects for research on the social and geographic dimensions of self-organizing behavior in social-ecological systems spanning wide regional areas.",31-Jan,2014,17,1,10.18564/jasss.2297,http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.2297

Methods: A detailed representation of the Boston area was constructed, based on data about individuals, locations, and activity patterns. Influenza-like illness (ILI) transmission was simulated, producing 100 years of in silico ILI data. Six different surveillance systems were designed and developed using gathered cases from the simulated disease data. Performance was measured by inserting test outbreaks into the surveillance streams and analyzing the likelihood and timeliness of detection. Results: Detection of outbreaks varied from 21% to 95%. Increased coverage did not linearly improve detection probability for all surveillance systems. Relaxing the decision threshold for signaling outbreaks greatly increased false-positives, improved outbreak detection slightly, and led to earlier outbreak detection.

In this paper we present a discussion of the nature of agent-based modelling from nursing's philosophical perspectives and truth criteria as a means of evaluating this methodological tool's disciplinary fit. Background. Agent-based modelling is a new methodological tool used to study complex systems. Researchers from a multitude of disciplines are using agent-based models to enhance understanding of problems that transcend disciplinary and geographical boundaries. Because of the growing interest in complexity science in the discipline of nursing, this new tool may prove useful for nurses engaged in research and theory development. Data sources. Electronic indexes and iterative bibliographic searches were used to identify papers, books and abstracts addressing agent-based modelling. In order to trace the emergence of the topic in the literature, date limiting parameters were not used. Selected studies from the international literature were limited to English language reports in the social sciences. The work was completed in 2008. Discussion. Recurrent themes concerning the use of agent-base modelling include heterogeneity, dynamics, adaption, emergence and 'bridging'. The themes were congruent with philosophical views and metanarratives in nursing. Implications for nursing. Agent-based models offer practical advantages in the pursuit of new knowledge, including the ability to pilot research studies using simulation or to visualize potential practice changes prior to implementation. Conclusion. The use of agent-based modelling as tool for nursing theory development, should be expanded. As nurses and other researchers become more familiar with the use of these models, methodological critique will contribute to the development of increasingly valid models.",APR,2011,67,4,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05545.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05545.x

The model incorporates differential income between two classes of agents, a simplified market mechanism for the purchase of housing, and a simple geographic structure of one central city and four symmetrically arranged suburbs. Agents derive utility from neighborhood racial composition, the size of their lot, private amenities that are specific to neighborhoods, and public amenities that stretch across municipalities. We find that the public-amenities term leads to a positive-feedback loop in which migration to suburbs increases the public amenities in those municipalities while lowering amenities in the central city, thus sparking further migration. When the minority agents are uniformly less affluent than the majority agents, this dynamic produces discontinuity in segregation as measured by centralization. Such discontinuities are typical of first-order phase transitions. When minority and majority incomes overlap, significant regions appear over which there are multistable equilibria at high and low levels of segregation, along with considerable sensitivity to the initial distribution of minority agents. We discuss the implications of these findings.",NOV,2009,36,6,10.1068/b33029,http://dx.doi.org/10.1068/b33029

Linear models and static strategies have difficulty capturing complex relationships and regional heterogeneity. Therefore, we aim to suggest an optimal subregional joint policy under fiscal constraints. This study uses agent-based modeling with geographic information systems to construct a cross -regional recycling system model that assesses the economic and environmental effects of policies. Based on actual data, the model considers four subsystems, multiple region types, two battery types, and six stakeholders. The results show that: (1) The optimal subregional joint policy can increase the average formal recycling rate from 28.44 % to 48.58 % and achieve an emission reduction rate of 19.81 %; (2) In underdeveloped regions, allocating 70-80 % of fiscal funds to supervision can achieve optimal economic and environmental benefits; and (3) For the local governments with few formal sectors, investing in a unit subsidy exceeding $1.4/kWh will diminish economic efficiency. Provincial governments in economically developed areas with formal business clusters should provide higher subsidies, while other regions should allocate more fiscal expenditure for supervision.

However, previous studies have had a limited understanding of how evacuation performance is affected by the arrangement of evacuation shelters (with respect to their number and geographical distribution) and human behaviors (with respect to the heterogeneity of household evacuation preparation times and route-searching strategies). In this study, we develop an integrated socio-hydrological modeling framework that couples (1) a hydrodynamic model for flood simulation, (2) an agent-based model for evacuation management policies and human behaviors, and (3) a transportation model for simulating household evacuation processes in a road network. We apply the model to the Xiong'an New Area and examine household evacuation outcomes for various shelter location plans and human behavior scenarios. The results show that household evacuation processes are significantly affected by the number and geographical distribution of evacuation shelters. Surprisingly, we find that establishing more shelters may not improve evacuation results if the shelters are not strategically located. We also find that low heterogeneity in evacuation preparation times can result in heavy traffic congestion and long evacuation clearance times. If each household selects their own shortest route without considering the effects of other evacuees' route choices, traffic congestion will likely occur, thereby reducing system-level evacuation performance. These results demonstrate the unique functionality of our model with respect to supporting flood risk assessment and advancing our understanding of how multiple management and behavioral factors jointly affect evacuation performance.",17-Apr,2023,27,7,10.5194/hess-27-1607-2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1607-2023
"Ding, Tianran; Achten, Wouter M. J.",Coupling agent-based modeling with territorial LCA to support agricultural land-use planning,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,"Life cycle assessment (LCA) is applied to assess large-scale systems supporting policymaking. However, most LCA studies focused on evaluating the impacts of policies and strategic planning on a static basis ignoring the dynamic nature of the territory in which the policies are implemented. This study aims to develop a dynamic territorial LCA approach, linking agent-based modeling (ABM) with the territorial LCA approach. ABM is a widely used tool to simulate dynamic emerging systems considering human factors, and the territorial LCA is a recently developed approach featuring assessing multi-functional territories. To prove the concept, the framework of the dynamic territorial LCA was implemented in a case study of promoting bioenergy crops in an agricultural territory of the southern region of Belgium (Wallonia), considering farm size, familiarity, and revenue. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) was employed to assess site-specific environmental impacts of individual decisions. The case study contrasts spatial and temporal dynamics of the territory if implementing demonstration farms at different locations, assuming adopters will be provided with subsidies over simulation time, and farmers' familiarities increase when nearby farmers turn into adopters. The results show that different initial locations for demonstration farms would lead to different dynamic results at the territorial level. Such knowledge on the interactions between human behaviors and land-use scenarios could bring insights for policymaking, supporting reasonable land planning at the territorial level. Besides, by employing GIS to estimate spatially explicit inventory of unit processes, this work fills the research gap of the lack of application linking LCA, ABM, and GIS together. Further studies could be conducted to, e.g., explore the introduction of multiple land use functions (besides bioenergy production) and various policy schemes, enhance socio-economic impact assessment, and combine with other approaches to support decision making, e.g., participatory modeling and spatial optimization.",20-Dec,2022,380,,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.134914,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.134914

One of these concerns the difficulty to model a complex system at a high resolution (fine-grained) level at which the spread can be simulated by taking into account individual features. Agent-based modeling usually needs to find an optimal trade-off between the resolution of the simulation and the population size. Indeed, modeling single individuals usually leads to simulations of smaller populations or the use of meta-populations. In this article, we propose a solution to efficiently model the Covid-19 spread in Lombardy, themost populated Italian region with about ten million people. In particular, the model described in this paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt in literature to model a large population at the single-individual level. To achieve this goal, we propose a framework that implements: i. a scale-free model of the social contacts combining a sociability rate, demographic information, and geographical assumptions; ii. a multi-agent system relying on the actor model and the High-Performance Computing technology to efficiently implement ten million concurrent agents. We simulated the epidemic scenario from January to April 2020 and from August to December 2020, modeling the government's lockdown policies and people's mask-wearing habits.

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy leads to high cure rates. However, persons who inject drugs (PWID) are at risk for reinfection after cure and may require multiple DAA treatments to reach the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of HCV elimination by 2030. Using an agent-based model (ABM) that accounts for the complex interplay of demographic factors, risk behaviors, social networks, and geographic location for HCV transmission among PWID, we examined the combination(s) of DAA enrollment (2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, 10%), adherence (60%, 70%, 80%, 90%) and frequency of DAA treatment courses needed to achieve the WHO's goal of reducing incident chronic infections by 90% by 2030 among a large population of PWID from Chicago, IL and surrounding suburbs. We also estimated the economic DAA costs associated with each scenario. Our results indicate that a DAA treatment rate of >7.5% per year with 90% adherence results in 75% of enrolled PWID requiring only a single DAA course; however 19% would require 2 courses, 5%, 3 courses and <2%, 4 courses, with an overall DAA cost of $325 million to achieve the WHO goal in metropolitan Chicago. We estimate a 28% increase in the overall DAA cost under low adherence (70%) compared to high adherence (90%).

Besides entering Eurasia via a terrestrial route, humans may have used sea straits. These routes would have shaped the subsequent expansions in Eurasia. Sea straits, in particular, are an additional option for entering Eurasia. However, the chances of sea crossings into Eurasia have not yet been quantified. Here, we apply an agent-based model for human water crossing to quantify the crossing success for the Gibraltar Strait, the Sicily Strait, and the Bab-al-Mandab Strait during the Late Pleistocene. The environment of the model consists of geographic explicit reconstructions of the sea straits, including water temperature, current speed and direction, along with terrestrial data of resource distribution and topography. We tested five behavioral scenarios of water movement skills of Late Pleistocene modern humans in a cold phase, represented by the Last Glacial Maximum, and a warm phase, represented by the Last Interglacial. We quantified the impact of water movement skills and climate on the crossing success by the crossing success rate (CSR). Our results show that Africa could be left via the Bab-al-Mandab Strait without specific rafting technology. At low sea level, even passive drifting was sufficient to cross the strait.

This paper aims to present the design and implementation of an Irrigation Agent-Based Model (IABM) for the distribution of water in an irrigation district. In the IABM proposed, each field or farm can be considered as a micro-level and a region or irrigation district as a macro-level. The most approximated irrigation scheduling at each micro-level allows determining the water needs at the macro-level, as a reference for the negotiation of water distribution. A Geographical Information System (GIS) was used to manage georeferenced field information. Field capacity and permanent wilting point values, initial soil moisture, crop types, crop coefficients, root depth, sowing dates and weather data were incorporated into the IABM model for determining irrigation prescriptions. When water available in the irrigation district is insufficient to supply water requirements of all the irrigation fields, the IABM allows water distribution among them according to the cultivated field sizes, irrigation priorities, phenological states and the behavior of neighbors. When water resources are distributable, the proposed negotiation algorithm ensures that fields will use irrigation prescriptions defined with technical and agronomic criteria, thus avoiding the waste of water resource. The IABM developed meets the satisfaction requirement of the greatest number of agents by avoiding as much as possible that the soil water stress increases, using 25% of permissible level of moisture depletion respect to the total available water in each field.",1-Oct,2021,256,,10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107088,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107088

In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of sanitation felling on stopping the spread of a bark beetle population from an un-managed to a managed forest area. For this, we advance an individual-based dispersion model of Ips typographus by adding the influence of wind on the beetle dispersion and by importing GIS data to simulate real world forests. To validate the new model version and to find reasonable parameter values, we conduct simulation experiments to reproduce infestation patterns that occurred in 2015, 2016, and 2017 within the national park Saxon Switzerland, Germany. With the then calibrated model IPS-SPREADS (Infestation Pattern Simulation Supporting PREdisposition Assessment DetailS), we investigate the impact of different factors such as the distance between beetle source trees and the forest border on the amount of damage within the managed forest stand and test the effectiveness of different levels of sanitation felling and its point of action on reducing the amount of damaged trees. As expected, the results of the model calibration show that the direction of wind plays an important role for the occurring infestation patterns and that bark beetle energy reserve is reduced during mass outbreaks. The results of the second experiment show that the main drivers for the amount of damaged trees are the primary attractiveness and the distance to beetle source trees. Sanitation felling effectiveness is highest when performed near the beetle source trees, with considerably high felling intensities and if there is at least some distance to the managed forest. IPS-SPREADS can be used in future studies as a tool for testing further management measures (e.g., pheromone traps) or to assess the risk for bark beetle infestations of forest areas near to wind-felled or already infested trees.",26-Jul,2021,4,,10.3389/ffgc.2021.704930,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/ffgc.2021.704930

When trying to control regional spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), decision makers must choose the highest-yield facilities to target for interventions. The question is, with limited resources, how best to choose these facilities. Methods. Using our Regional Healthcare Ecosystem Analyst-generated agent-based model of all Chicago metropolitan area inpatient facilities, we simulated the spread of CRE and different ways of choosing facilities to apply a prevention bundle (screening, chlorhexidine gluconate bathing, hand hygiene, geographic separation, and patient registry) to a resource-limited 1686 inpatient beds. Results. Randomly selecting facilities did not impact prevalence, but averted 620 new carriers and 175 infections, saving $6.3 million in total costs compared to no intervention. Selecting facilities by type (eg, long-term acute care hospitals) yielded a 16.1% relative prevalence decrease, preventing 1960 cases and 558 infections, saving $62.4 million more than random selection. Choosing the largest facilities was better than random selection, but not better than by type. Selecting by considering connections to other facilities (ie, highest volume of discharge patients) yielded a 9.5% relative prevalence decrease, preventing 1580 cases and 470 infections, and saving $51.6 million more than random selection. Selecting facilities using a combination of these metrics yielded the greatest reduction (19.0% relative prevalence decrease, preventing 1840 cases and 554 infections, saving $59.6 million compared with random selection). Conclusions. While choosing target facilities based on single metrics (eg, most inpatient beds, most connections to other facilities) achieved better control than randomly choosing facilities, more effective targeting occurred when considering how these and other factors (eg, patient length of stay, care for higher-risk patients) interacted as a system.",1-Feb,2021,72,3,10.1093/cid/ciaa072,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa072

Gregg",Modeling pastoralist movement in response to environmental variables and conflict in Somaliland: Combining agent-based modeling and geospatial data,PLOS ONE,"Pastoralism is widely practiced in arid lands and is the primary means of livelihood for approximately 268 million people across Africa. Environmental, interpersonal, and transactional variables such as vegetation and water availability, conflict, ethnic tensions, and private/public land delineation influence the movements of these populations. The challenges of climate change and conflict are widely felt by nomadic pastoralists in Somalia, where resources are scarce, natural disasters are increasingly common, and protracted conflict has plagued communities for decades. Bereft of real-time data, researchers and programmatic personnel often turn to post hoc analysis to understand the interaction between climate, conflict, and migration, and design programs to address the needs of nomadic pastoralists. By designing an Agent-Based Model to simulate the movement of nomadic pastoralists based on typologically-diverse, historical data of environmental, interpersonal, and transactional variables in Somaliland and Puntland between 2008 and 2018, this study explores how pastoralists respond to changing environments. Through subsequent application of spatial analysis such as choropleth maps, kernel density mapping, and standard deviational ellipses, we characterize the resultant pastoralist population distribution in response to these variables. Outcomes demonstrate a large scale spatio-temporal trend of pastoralists migrating to the southeast of the study area with high density areas in the south of Nugaal, the northwest of Sool, and along the Ethiopian border. While minimal inter-seasonal variability is seen, multiple analyses support the consolidation of pastoralists to specifically favorable regions. Exploration of the large-scale population, climate, and conflict trends allows for cogent narratives and associative hypotheses regarding the pastoralist migration during the study period. While this model produces compelling associations between pastoralist movements and terrestrial and conflict variables, it relies heavily on assumptions and incomplete data that are not necessarily representative of realities on the ground.

Despite the increasing frequency and severity of chemical accidents, few researchers have argued for the necessity of developing scenarios and simulation models for these accidents. Combining the TRANSIMS (Transportation Analysis and Simulation System) agent-based model with the ALOHA (Areal Location of Hazardous Atmospheres) dispersion model, this study aims to develop a modeling framework for simulating emergency evacuations in response to large-scale chemical accidents. The baseline accident scenario assumed the simultaneous leakage of toxic chemicals from industrial complexes near residential areas. The ALOHA model results showed that approximately 60% of residents in the scenario's city were required to evacuate their homes. The majority of evacuees completed their evacuations within 5 h in the baseline scenario (evacuating maximum number of private vehicles without any intervention), while the distribution of the population and street network density caused geographical variability in clearance time. Clearance time can be significantly reduced by changing both the evacuees' behaviors and the evacuation policy, which suggests the necessity for proper public intervention when the mass evacuation of residents is required due to chemical accidents.",DEC,2020,17,24,10.3390/ijerph17249442,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17249442

These distributions interact with the birds' innate program during migration and are critical to successful migration. Hence, favourable environmental conditions for migration consequently lead to spatio-temporal concentrations, and the evolution of specific migratory flyways. Based on the aerodynamic properties of the ten most abundant nocturnal long-distance migrants, we developed a computational framework to simulate millions of individual trajectories across Europe using an agent-based simulation approach. We simulated a three-week period of autumn migration with a temporal resolution of 30 s. Departure conditions were derived from bird densities observed within the first two hours after sunset, which were extracted from the weather radar network. Individual itineraries were strongly influenced by the behavioural reactions to the environment such as the wind flow, coastlines and mountain ranges. Wind speed and direction are among the key factors that shape migration patterns such as reverse movements observed within some nights. Accumulation of migration was triggered by the combined effect of geographic barriers (coastlines, mountain ranges) and wind. The overall result of the simulation corresponds well with the large-scale pattern of bird migration intensities measured across the study area, for instance the high migration intensity observed between the Atlantic coast and the Pyrenees. Our model framework conjoins all important domains, such as the birds' preconditions and behavioural scope, as well as the spatio-temporal dynamics of the environment. However, for the time being we cannot decide whether local discrepancies between model and data are due to environmental effects that are not yet captured by our simulation (i.e. effect of rain on migration intensity), or caused by differences in the sensitivity of the local ,weather, radar . systems. Due to the limited time period and lack of more accurate data for validation, our findings are preliminary. Further progress in data quality and - hopefully better access of bird profiles from the continent-wide weather radar network will allow to improve model performance and implement a bird migration forecasting similar to weather forecasts.

Songbirds have previously been described as agents of tick dispersal, and a combination of empirical data and modeling efforts have implicated songbirds in the range expansion of I. scapularis northward into Canada during spring bird migration. The role of fall bird migration has received comparatively less attention, particularly at a continental scale. The aim of the current research was to use a novel individual-based modeling approach (IBM) to investigate the role of southward migrating songbirds in the dispersal of I. scapularis within the continental United States. The IBM used in this research explicitly models dispersal by two extensively studied migrating songbird species, wood thrush Hylocichla mustelina and ovenbird Serums aurocapillus. Our IBM predicts the annual dispersal of more than four million ticks by H. mustelina and S. aurocapillus, notably into areas as far west as the Dakotas, and as far south as Central Alabama. Predicted dispersal locations include areas where the southern phenotype of I. scapularis dominates, suggestive of a possible mechanism for previously described unidirectional gene flow from north to south. In addition, the model demonstrates that three species-specific songbird traits - breeding range, migration timing, and propensity for tick attachment - each play a major role in the relative magnitude of tick dispersal by different songbird species. The pattern of I. scapularis dispersal predicted by this model suggests that migrating songbirds may have contributed to the range expansion of the tick historically, and may continue to do so presently and into the future, particularly as climate changes the geographic areas that are suitable for I. scapularis. Ultimately, widespread tick dispersal by migrating songbirds likely increases the human risk of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases in the United States.",AUG,2019,10,5,10.1016/j.ttbdis.2019.05.012,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2019.05.012

In the State of Kuwait, there is a unique set of push and pull factors: government subsidised housing for citizens, the existence of a single urban area, and the initiation of a new and ambitious master plan for the construction of 12 new cities, which are expected to attract not only locals, but also international residents and businesses. On top of these factors, there is an unusual demographic situation, as non-citizens outnumber Kuwaiti citizens by a factor of 2.3, with these groups having widely different preferences in terms of housing. Currently, there is no plan to take these resident groups' opinions into consideration for the new cities project. Besides, the current study simulates the impacts of the involvement of residents in urban planning. Samples from resident groups (citizens and non-citizens) participated in targeted surveys and useful answers were extracted in relation to the migration likelihood, push and pull factors that may affect their decisions, spatial preferences for new cities and their opinions on segregation by nationality. Specifically, the survey results showed significant interest of residents in moving to the new cities. For citizens, the most important factors in deciding whether to move or not were proximity to their close family and housing availability, while for non-citizens the most important factor was the creation of new employment opportunities. Both survey groups agreed that existing city property prices are too high and make the prospect of moving to a new city more attractive. The responses were transferred in an Agent Based Model, and the simulations showed certain differences to the official projections for 2050 without the public responses, in regards to the geographical distribution of the most desirable suburbs. Furthermore, the simulations showed that in the new cities, nationality segregation levels are expected to drop by at least 15% compared to the 2015 levels.

This is particularly an issue in the developing world where access to basic data is limited and travel is often complex and multi-modal. Improving the accuracy and relevance in this context requires greater accessibility to, and flexibility in, travel time modelling tools to facilitate the incorporation of local knowledge and the rapid exploration of multiple travel scenarios. The aim of this work was to develop simple open source, adaptable, interactive travel time modelling tools to allow greater access to and participation in service access analysis. Results: Described are three interconnected applications designed to reduce some of the barriers to the more wide-spread use of GIS analysis of service access and allow for complex spatial and temporal variations in service availability. These applications are an open source GIS tool-kit and two geo-simulation models. The development of these tools was guided by health service issues from a developing world context but they present a general approach to enabling greater access to and flexibility in health access modelling. The tools demonstrate a method that substantially simplifies the process for conducting travel time assessments and demonstrate a dynamic, interactive approach in an open source GIS format. In addition this paper provides examples from empirical experience where these tools have informed better policy and planning. Conclusion: Travel and health service access is complex and cannot be reduced to a few static modeled outputs. The approaches described in this paper use a unique set of tools to explore this complexity, promote discussion and build understanding with the goal of producing better planning outcomes. The accessible, flexible, interactive and responsive nature of the applications described has the potential to allow complex environmental social and political considerations to be incorporated and visualised.

Most existing spatially explicit LCMs represent land use or cover using either pixel or polygon/patch spatial units. However, the effects of the choice to use pixel versus polygonal land units on the outputs from any given model have not yet been systematically assessed. We evaluated the impacts of alternative land units on the performance of a LCM. A stochastic LCM based on a geostatistical algorithm was developed and applied using both pixel and polygons, which were derived from parcel maps. Nine possible parcel-change scenarios were generated to evaluate the effects of geometric change in management boundaries. The approach was tested through the simulation of multiple land-cover transitions in Medina County, Ohio, between 1992 and 2011. Performance of the simulations was assessed using a metric for the accuracy of spatial allocations (figure of merit (FoM)) and several landscape pattern metrics describing the shapes and sizes of resulting land-cover patches. Results support the notion that there is a clear trade-off between pixel and polygon land units: using polygon boundaries is helpful in obtaining more realistic spatial patterns, but at the cost of location accuracy. Significant differences were found among different parcel-change scenarios on both location accuracy and spatial patterns, with the primary effects being dependent on the type of land-cover transition and the resolution at which validation was assessed.",,2017,31,4,10.1080/13658816.2016.1231316,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2016.1231316

These four MCDM methods were selected according to their appropriateness for computational processing in ACE applications.

An illustrational decision-making scenario was used which allows the mutual comparison of all of the selected decision making methods.

In this paper, we present a mechanism for bridging the gap between individual agency and regional outcomes of that agency in simulation. We use agents to develop very rich behavioral understanding of their surroundings in simulation. We then sweep through the information that agents generate when determining how to execute their transition rules, using schemes that mine agent states to produce mental maps of varied aspects of their dynamics. From agents' mental maps, we define and visualize regions as geographies that are conjured from the unique, autonomous, local, and personal insight that agents can provide. We demonstrate the utility of the scheme, with application to indoor movement scenarios in which fleeting regions form amid agents interactions with each other and their built surroundings. Our approach is extensible beyond these applications and could be of broader use for other explorative scenarios in regional science.",NOV,2016,57,2月3日,10.1007/s00168-015-0682-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00168-015-0682-0

In this context, parallel simulation is an attractive solution when dealing with massive data and computation requirements. Nearly all the available distributed simulation systems, however, do not support geospatial phenomena modeling, dynamic data injection, and real-time visualization. To tackle these problems, we propose a distributed dynamic-data driven simulation and analysis system (4D-SAS) specifically for massive spatial agent-based modeling to support real-time representation and analysis of geospatial phenomena. To accomplish large-scale geospatial problem-solving, the 4D-SAS system was spatially enabled to support geospatial model development and employs high-performance computing to improve simulation performance. It can automatically decompose simulation tasks and distribute them among computing nodes following two common schemes: order division or spatial decomposition. Moreover, it provides streaming channels and a storage database to incorporate dynamic data into simulation models; updating agent context in real-time. A new online visualization module was developed based on a GIS mapping library, SharpMap, for an animated display of model execution to help clients understand the model outputs efficiently. To evaluate the system's efficiency and scalability, two different spatially explicitly agent-based models, an en-route choice model, and a forest fire propagation model, were created on 4D-SAS. Simulation results illustrate that 4D-SAS provides an efficient platform for dynamic data-driven geospatial modeling, e.g., both discrete multi-agent simulation and grid-based cellular automata, demonstrating efficient support for massive parallel simulation. The parallel efficiency of the two models is above 0.7 and remains nearly stable in our experiments.",APR,2016,5,4,10.3390/ijgi5040042,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5040042

Methods Using an agent-based simulation model, we examine the interaction of race-based constraints with other experimental conditions that can affect minorities' residential choice sets.

However, racial parity in communities also decreases the environmental quality gap, as do slower population growth and larger geographies.

Understanding and estimating the transboundary impacts is essential to portraying the interactions among the different agents and in the search for the optimal configuration of the bioenergy value chain. We develop an agent-based model to mimic the decision making by feedstock producers and feedstock-to-biofuel conversion plant operators and propose multipliers (i.e., ratios of economic values accruing to different segments and associated agents in the value chain) for assessing the transboundary impacts. Our approach is generic and thus applicable to a variety of bioenergy production systems at different sites and geographic scales. We apply it to the case of producing ethanol using corn stover in Iowa, USA. The results from the case study indicate that stover removal rate is site specific and varies considerably with soil type, as well as other factors, such as stover price and harvesting cost. In addition, ethanol production using corn stover in the study region would have strong positive ripple effects, with the values of multipliers varying with greenhouse gas price and national energy security premium.

These dynamics are affected by a variety of variables, spanning economic, structural, political and environmental. With respect to this latter aspect, much research has explored the relationship between the development of urban green areas, the increase of price and the formation of gentrification. Within this context, the present work explores housing mobility and gentrification dynamics proposing a mixed-method approach that combines a spatially explicit agent-based model (ABM), a Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and a Hedonic Price (HP). The case study of the transformation project of Victoria Park in Brisbane (Australia) is used to verify the applicability of this integrated approach. In the methodological framework proposed, the ABM simulates the housing mobility of the residents through an individual decision-making process, where the likelihood of mobility is based on various empirical endogenous factors (i.e., household socio-economic characteristics) and exogenous ones (i.e., market variation). The MCDA supports the identification of the relative importance of these factors using a panel of local experts and stakeholders. The Spatial HP explores the impact of urban parks on real estate prices. The current study found the abilities of MCDA and HP to reduce the assumptions of ABM by generating quali-quantitative information of citizens' behaviors and estimating price increase.

Using an agent-based model to understand the intensity of prehistoric coastal occupation, and what it means for studies on the evolution of the coastal adaptation",QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL,"The origins and significance of an aquatic diet in hominin evolution is a scientific research topic of high sig-nificance. Some have argued that marine shellfish collection was a key ingredient in the emergence of modern human behavioral and cultural complexity. The collection of marine resources, which can be productive and predictable, may have evolved into a coastal adaptation that led to reduction in residential mobility and other important changes in behavior and culture. Therefore, studying the emergence and intensity of coastal occu-pations is important to understand the rise of this particular aspect of modern humans' behavioral and cultural evolution. In this article, we use an agent-based model to explore the interaction between foraging behavior and the environment, and the impact of such interaction on sites' length of occupation, which in turn affects the accumulation of artifacts and ecofacts. The results of the model suggest that the intensive occupation of coastal sites is likely to be influenced by their position within a restricted band of productive coastal habitat. Even when foragers spend most of their time in other habitats, the cyclical reoccupation of coastal sites - due to the coast's cyclical productivity as well as the low number of locations that can be occupied there - could naturally result in higher artifact density in coastal than inland sites. Here, we argue that, given those results, coastal locations should accumulate large and dense deposits of occupation debris. These will be obvious features on the landscape and should be easier to find than inland occupations because of the coastal habitats' confined space. Finally, given the higher find densities of those sites, this may lead archaeologists to overestimate the contribution of marine resources in prehistoric diets. Therefore, what archaeologists have interpreted as intensive coastal adaptation in the past may be more the result of geographical constraints rather than important evolutionary changes.",20-Nov,2022,638,,10.1016/j.quaint.2022.02.003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2022.02.003

Worldwide, land-based environmental conservation efforts and agricultural preservation regulations are often concurrent. Complex social-ecological feedback within the coupled natural and human systems nevertheless confounds their effects. Drawing on population-level data for a township encompassed by a national nature reserve, this study applies a spatially explicit agent-based model to understand human-environment interrelationships with household landuse decisions about cropland abandonment restricted by the agricultural preservation rule. Results show that labor migration and cropland abandonment involve feedback loops that exhibit nonlinear effects. The availability of household labor and the amount of cultivated land mediate these effects. The land-use decisions of the farm households are sensitive to the relaxation of the abandonment restriction. The prevalence of cropland abandonment in extent and size increases prominently as the restriction rule begins to relax. The model shows a clearly emerging spatial pattern of an increasing likelihood of cropland abandonment with the relaxed restriction. Abandonment is more likely on dryland parcels and parcels at higher elevations, steeper slopes, and in proximity to forest areas. The shifted distributions of cropland parcels by their biophysical and geographical features from the baseline scenario (full restriction) to the experimental scenario (complete relaxation) also demonstrate these trends. Targeting cropland parcels bearing high risks of abandonment can improve the costeffectiveness of implementing forest restoration policies while prioritizing those with low risks for agricultural stabilization. The agent-based model is useful for explaining the underlying drivers of land change involving human decision-making. It also suggests implications for balancing trade-offs between environmental conservation and agricultural production.",JUN,2022,38,,10.1016/j.ancene.2022.100337,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ancene.2022.100337

Nevertheless, supply chains are also social networks where multiple stakeholders have to collaborate while they have different, and sometimes, diverging objectives. For this reason, having a more realistic model representing collaboration between the various stakeholders involved is necessary and new methods that facilitate the development of a shared representation of the system must be introduced. We propose to import a participatory method, PARDI (Problematic, Actors, Resources, Dynamics and Interactions), from the Socio-Environmental System community to the practices of the Process System Engineering community. Based on this method, we develop a participatory process in order to collect the necessary knowledge on the supply chain and its context. Following this participatory process, we then develop an Agent-Based Model as a simulation and decision making tool to support collective scenario analyses and collectively draw solutions with stakeholders. Our participatory modeling approach necessarily imposes a multi stakeholders vision (within the modeling but also in the result analyses) and therefore the search for a modeling consensus. Thus, it brings a better inclusion of social aspects in problem solving which are usually poorly considered leading to implementation failure sometimes. By comparing our approach with the classic one of the Process Systems Engineering community, we highlight the strengths and weaknesses of both and how complementary they can be. A case study on the already existing supply chain of the chestnut wood in Cevennes area (France) illustrates the capabilities of our participatory methodology. It focuses on the socio-economic model design of the first two steps (forestry activities to harvest) in the supply chain as the latter is locked because of economic and social organisation issues. The objective is to find the best action levers to unlock the resistance that forest plot owners have to remove declining wood from their land. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Rule-based fisheries models are faced with several challenges. First, for large geographical problems like oceans, they require considerable time to find satisfactory solutions. Second, they tend to be reactive rather than anticipatory. Behavioural assumptions directly impact fishers' capacity for adaptation and behaviour, which influences possible management strategies. To capture style and speed of adaptation to changes in the environment, coupled human-environment models must progress toward cognitively and socio-culturally realistic representations of fisher decision-making. In this paper, we implement the erotetic decision-making model in the POSEIDON fisheries model. The agents replicate observed behaviours such as fishing the line of a Marine Protected Area, using Individually Tradable Quotas, and returning to favoured fishing locations, and learning to break rules given harsh constraints.

Risk modelling is commonly conducted at the community/regional scale using GIS. However, people and objects move in response to a crisis, so static approaches cannot capture the dynamics of the risk properly, as they do not accommodate objects' movements within time and space. The emergence of Agent-Based Modelling makes it possible to model the risk at an individual level as it evolves overspace and time. We propose a new approach of Spatio-Temporal Dynamics Model of Risk (STDMR) by integrating multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) within a georeferenced agent-based model, using Mt. Merapi, Indonesia, as a case study. The model makes it possible to simulate the spatio-temporal dynamics of those at risk during a volcanic crisis. Importantly, individual vulnerability is heterogeneous and depends on the characteristics of the individuals concerned. The risk for the individuals is dynamic and changes along with the hazard and their location. The model is able to highlight a small number of high-risk spatio-temporal positions where, due to the behaviour of individuals who are evacuating the volcano and the dynamics of the hazard itself, the overall risk in those times and places is extremely high. These outcomes are extremely relevant for the stakeholders, and the work of coupling an ABM, MCE, and dynamic volcanic hazard is both novel and contextually relevant.",1-Apr,2020,23,2,10.18564/jasss.4241,http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4241

ABMs are increasingly used to study healthcare-associated infections (ie, infections acquired during admission to a healthcare facility), including Clostridioides difficile infection, currently the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States. The overall burden and transmission dynamics of healthcare-associated infections, including C difficile infection, may be influenced by community sources and movement of people among healthcare facilities and communities. These complex dynamics warrant geospatially explicit ABMs that extend beyond single healthcare facilities to include entire systems (eg, hospitals, nursing homes and extended care facilities, the community). The agents in ABMs can be built on a synthetic population, a model-generated representation of the actual population with associated spatial (eg, home residence), temporal (eg, change in location over time), and nonspatial (eg, sociodemographic features) attributes. We describe our methods to create a geospatially explicit ABM of a major regional healthcare network using a synthetic population as microdata input. We illustrate agent movement in the healthcare network and the community, informed by patient-level medical records, aggregate hospital discharge data, healthcare facility licensing data, and published literature. We apply the ABM output to visualize agent movement in the healthcare network and the community served by the network. We provide an application example of the ABM to C difficile infection using a natural history submodel.

"Chow, T. Edwin",A crowdsourcing-geocomputational framework of mobile crowd simulation and estimation,CARTOGRAPHY AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SCIENCE,"Population estimation typically involves counting a group of individuals at a specific place and time. Estimating people on the move, i.e. a mobile population, is an intellectual challenge both in theory and in practice. The research objective is to develop a framework to estimate mobile population by simulating crowd behaviors based on crowdsourced data. The framework includes the following steps: (1) collecting and analyzing small area population movements (i.e. density and walking speed) from crowdsourced pictures and trajectories; (2) reconstructing the mobile population dynamics during a rally using a GIS; and (3) simulating the mobile population by using agent-based modeling. In this model, each individual is encoded as an agent with associated rules to define their crowd behaviors in walking, stopping, and personal spacing. Each agent moves toward the cell with next lowest distance if the occupying capacity of the cell area has not exceeded the crowd density at that time. By simulating crowd movements and behaviors, crowd size can be estimated by comparing the simulation time with observed rally time taken by the real crowd. The intellectual merits and research findings shed useful insights to improve mobile population estimation, and leverage alternative data sources to support related scientific applications.",2-Jan,2019,46,1,10.1080/15230406.2018.1524314,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230406.2018.1524314

This makes person-based approaches more favorable than traditional aggregated approaches in recent years. However, person-based accessibility measures require detailed individual trip data which are very difficult and expensive to acquire, especially at large scales. In addition, traveling by public transportation is a highly time sensitive activity, which can hardly be handled by traditional accessibility measures. This paper presents an agent-based model for simulating individual work trips in hoping to provide an alternative or supplementary solution to person-based accessibility study. In the model, population is simulated as three levels of agents: census tracts, households, and individual workers. And job opportunities (businesses) are simulated as employer agents. Census tract agents have the ability to generate household and worker agents based on their demographic profiles and a road network. Worker agents are the most active agents that can search jobs and find the best paths for commuting. Employer agents can estimate the number of transit-dependent employees, hire workers, and update vacancies. A case study is conducted in the Milwaukee metropolitan area in Wisconsin.

"Kum, Susan S.; Northridge, Mary E.; Metcalf, Sara S.",Using focus groups to design systems science models that promote oral health equity,BMC ORAL HEALTH,"Background: While the US population overall has experienced improvements in oral health over the past 60 years, oral diseases remain among the most common chronic conditions across the life course. Further, lack of access to oral health care contributes to profound and enduring oral health inequities worldwide. Vulnerable and underserved populations who commonly lack access to oral health care include racial/ethnic minority older adults living in urban environments. The aim of this study was to use a systematic approach to explicate cause and effect relationships in creating a causal map, a type of concept map in which the links between nodes represent causality or influence. Methods: To improve our mental models of the real world and devise strategies to promote oral health equity, methods including system dynamics, agent-based modeling, geographic information science, and social network simulation have been leveraged by the research team. The practice of systems science modeling is situated amidst an ongoing modeling process of observing the real world, formulating mental models of how it works, setting decision rules to guide behavior, and from these heuristics, making decisions that in turn affect the state of the real world. Qualitative data were obtained from focus groups conducted with community-dwelling older adults who self-identify as African American, Dominican, or Puerto Rican to elicit their lived experiences in accessing oral health care in their northern Manhattan neighborhoods. Results: The findings of this study support the multi-dimensional and multi-level perspective of access to oral health care and affirm a theorized discrepancy in fit between available dental providers and patients. The lack of information about oral health at the community level may be compromising the use and quality of oral health care among racial/ethnic minority older adults. Conclusions: Well-informed community members may fill critical roles in oral health promotion, as they are viewed as highly credible sources of information and recommendations for dental providers. The next phase of this research will involve incorporating the knowledge gained from this study into simulation models that will be used to explore alternative paths toward improving oral health and health care for racial/ethnic minority older adults.",4-Jun,2018,18,,10.1186/s12903-018-0560-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12903-018-0560-0

The method can model a wide range of aggregators to suit various evaluation objectives that are close to human reasoning. The LSP method can aggregate an unlimited number of inputs without loss of significance. The main objective of this study is to develop and implement an integrated approach using the LSP method to represent the decision-making process of actors influencing urban residential development represented within an agent-based model (ABM). Geospatial data for the Clayton-Cloverdale neighborhood of the City of Surrey, Canada, was used to incorporate the LSP agent-based model to simulate land-use change at the cadastral level. The geo-simulations incorporated the decision-making process and interactions of agents as residents, developers, and city planners known as the main stakeholders with separate and sometimes conflicting priorities. The simulation results indicate a higher number of residents tend to choose mid-rise to high-rise buildings over single residential dwellings for a longer period of the time. This can be attributed to the lack affordability and developable land for housing in the future. The LSP method captured different agent decision-making reasoning that is closer to actual human logic which has resulted in the modeling outcomes of urban residential land-use to be in accordance to long term city plans.

One potential explanation for this pattern is that large-scale changes in climate and geography have, over evolutionary time, selected for traits that are favored under conditions found in contemporary midelevation regions. To test this hypothesis, we use records of historical temperature and topographic changes over the past 65 Myr to construct a general simulation model of plethodontid salamander evolution in eastern North America. We then explore possible mechanisms constraining species to midelevation bands by using the model to predict plethodontid evolutionary history and contemporary geographic distributions. Our results show that models that incorporate both temperature and topographic changes are better able to predict these patterns, suggesting that both processes may have played an important role in driving plethodontid evolution in the region.

Fields are continuous with values in the whole spatio-temporal domain of a model, while agents are bounded in space and often mobile. It is currently difficult for environmental modellers with limited software engineering background to construct such field-agent models, as modelling frameworks mostly do not support the integration of fields and agents. To overcome this issue, we describe a data model combining fields and agents in a single concept. This data model represents fields, agents and relations by grouping items sharing properties into a phenomenon. The concepts domain, property set and value handle spatio-temporal attribute representations.

We sought to investigate the impact of early vaccination on age-specific attack rates and evaluate the outcomes of different vaccination strategies that are influenced by the level of single or two-dose vaccine-induced protections. We developed and parameterized an agent-based model for two population demographics of urban and remote areas in Canada. Our results demonstrate that there is a time period before and after the onset of epidemic, during which the outcomes of vaccination strategies may differ significantly and are highly influenced by demographic characteristics. For the urban population, attack rates were lowest for children younger than 5 years of age in all vaccination strategies. However, for the remote population, the lowest attack rates were obtained for adults older than 50 years of age in most strategies. We found that the reduction of attack rates following the start of vaccination campaigns during the epidemic depends critically on the disease transmissibility, suggesting that for a sufficiently high transmissibility, vaccine delivery after the onset of epidemic has little or no effect, regardless of the population demographics.",14-Dec,2015,5,,10.1038/srep18062,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep18062

Agents make buying and movement decisions based on a set of simple costs they face from their current location. These spatial costs are reduced to two types: the costs of moving people and goods across geographical distances and the costs (and benefits) of 'being here' (the effects of being at a particular location such as land costs, amenities or disamenities). Two approaches to land cost are compared: landlords and a 'density cost' proxy. Emergent equilibrium outcomes are found to depend on the interaction of externalities and time. These findings are produced by looking at how agents react to changing four types of cost, two spatial and two non-spatial: commuting, wage, good cost and good delivery. The models explore equilibrium outcomes, the effect of changing costs and the impact of heterogeneous agents, before focusing in on one example to find the source of emergence in the externalities of agent choice. The paper finishes by emphasising the importance of thinking about emergence as a tool, not an end in itself. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

An A* pathfinding algorithm was implemented to produce walking routes, given data on the terrain in the area.

In this example, it was possible to impute daily activity movement patterns to the water resource for all villages in a 75 km long study transect across the Luangwa Valley, Zambia, and the simulated human movements were statistically similar to empirical observations on travel times to the water resource (Chi-squared, 95% confidence interval). This indicates that it is possible to produce realistic data regarding human movements without costly measurement as is commonly achieved, for example, through GPS, or retrospective or real-time diaries. The approach is transferable between different geographical locations, and the product can be useful in providing an insight into human movement patterns, and therefore has use in many human exposure-related applications, specifically epidemiological research in rural areas, where spatial heterogeneity in the disease landscape, and space-time proximity of individuals, can play a crucial role in disease spread.",30-Sep,2015,10,9,10.1371/journal.pone.0139505,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139505

H.","Optimal Preventive Maintenance, Repair, and Replacement Program for Catch Basins to Reduce Urban Flooding: Integrating Agent-Based Modeling and Monte Carlo Simulation",SUSTAINABILITY,"Urban sprawl has resulted in great losses of vegetation areas, an increase in impervious surfaces, and consequently the direct flow of stormwater into stream channels (i.e., the immediate flow of stormwater into stream channels, in comparison to the indirect flow that is represented by practices aiming to retain stormwater for a certain period of time and treat the polluted stormwater prior to flowing into the stream channels such as detention/retention basins, among others). Stormwater management systems such as catch basins (CBs) are needed to reduce the effect of stormwater runoff. Preventative maintenance, repair, and replacement of CBs are critical to achieve stormwater management best practices. Those practices prevent the blockage of the stormwater system, limit the pollutants in storm sewers, and reduce the risk of flooding. However, no preceding research studies have been conducted to model and simulate the serviceability of CBs and to determine optimal strategies for operating CBs. To that extent, this study establishes a framework to develop and validate an optimal and adaptive maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) strategy for CBs. In relation to that, an agent-based model (ABM) integrated with Monte Carlo simulation was developed for all 560 CBs in New York City's District 5 and was statistically validated using 99% confidence intervals. The MRO parameters were optimized to minimize the total cost of the system and attain the desired level of serviceability of CBs. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to guide the maintenance planning process of CBs and reveal the effect of the input parameters on the model's behavior. In addition, ten thousand Monte Carlo iterations were simulated to derive the distributions of the defined parameters. The results proved that in order to minimize the overall cost of repair, maintenance, and replacement of CBs and attain a minimum serviceability threshold of 80%, the following optimal MRO policy needs to be implemented: having seven service crews (where service crews are human resources (i.e., MRO teams) needed to perform the required maintenance, repair, and replacement work), implementing a replacing policy, and replacing CBs after five maintenance periods. The findings revealed that the service crews represent the most critical parameter in affecting the total cost and serviceability of CBs. This research contributes to the existing literature by offering a better knowledge of the management process of CBs and devising optimal MRO strategies for properly operating them. Ultimately, this research helps decision-makers and engineers increase the lifespan of CBs and limit their risks of breakdown, increase their efficiency, and avoid unnecessary costs. The proposed model is flexible and can be implemented to any geographical area and with other model/system parameters, which makes it adaptive for any scenario and area presented by the user. Finally, maintaining stormwater management practices helps in protecting the environment by decreasing the demand on stormwater systems, reducing flooding, protecting people and properties, promoting healthier rivers, and consequently creating more sustainable communities.",24-May,2023,15,11,10.3390/su15118527,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15118527

Calibration tests suggested that a seroprevalence of protective rabies antibodies 2.1 times higher than that inferred from seroprevalence in program assessments was required in simulations to replicate observed raccoon rabies cases. Our simulation results showed that if control interventions with an adjusted seroprevalence were used until 2025 or 2020, the probability of rabies elimination due to control intervention use was 49.2% and 42.1%, respectively. However, if controls were never used, the probability that initial rabies cases failed to establish a sustained outbreak was only 18.2%. In simulations where rabies was not successfully eliminated, using control interventions until 2025 resulted in 67% fewer new infections compared to only applying controls until 2020 and in 90% fewer new infections compared to no control intervention use. However, the model likely underestimated rabies elimination rates since we did not adjust for adaptive control strategies in response to changes in rabies distributions and case numbers, as well as extending control interventions past 2025.

"Mohd, Mohd Hafiz",Revisiting discrepancies between stochastic agent-based and deterministic models,COMMUNITY ECOLOGY,"Predicting which species will present (or absent) across geographical regions, and where, remains one of the important issues in ecology. From a methodical viewpoint, one of the concerns in examining species presence-absence across an environmental gradient is about the robustness of model-based predictions, which are given by distinct modelling frameworks used. Generally, different complexities and ecological factors are incorporated into such models, e.g. abiotic environments, spatial dispersal process, and stochasticity. Motivated by these ecological issues, we revisit a single-species logistic growth problem by employing stochastic agent-based model (ABM) and deterministic system and extend these frameworks to incorporate the effects of spatially changing environments. We observe that our ABM, which is formulated using random walk theory and birth-death process, demonstrates important qualitative behaviours that are consistent with the underlying theories of stochastic process. The results of ABM with large population sizes also agree with those of the deterministic equation. However, some discrepancies are observed when the population size is small. The ABM densities seem to underestimate the deterministic solutions, which illustrate the effects of stochasticity on small populations with some individuals may go extinct simply by chance. To quantify the underestimation of ABM as opposed to deterministic predictions, we employ certain probabilistic techniques: while the means of quasistationary probabilities distribution appear to give a counterintuitive prediction particularly near the edge of species ranges, the expected values given by state probabilities distribution are in agreement with the ABM densities observed for small population sizes across spatial locations. These salient observations depict emergent behaviours of stochastic ABM, which can contribute to additional insights on the dynamics of ecological species. It also shows how such small-scale interactions coupled with local dispersal and spatial phenomena occurring at a microscopic level can affect macroscopic-level dynamics. As such, comparing and contrasting the dynamics of different models can help in understanding the generality of ecological results and may offer important insights into the robustness of model-based predictions of species presence-absence.",OCT,2022,23,3,10.1007/s42974-022-00118-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42974-022-00118-2

The transportation vehicle energy transition from fossil fuels to electricity is promoted by policymakers and major automakers with an expectation of enhancing sustainability aspects such as fossil fuel consumption reduction, carbon emissions reduction, and lower operations and maintenance costs. However, the electrification of the existing transportation infrastructure system requires substantial upgrades to overcome two major concerns from ordinary drivers and the public. One is the driver's range anxiety based on the current capability of the electric vehicle (EV) technologies. The other is the availability of EV charging stations near the planned route. To address these two issues, we introduce an agent-based simulation model to project the consequences of electrification in the Indiana state highway system. Specifically, the model is developed to monitor the status of long-distance EV trips between different regions. The multi-agent engine method guarantees the model can adapt to diverse scenarios and complex environments. The simulation experiment verifies that the proposed model can provide the expected outcomes, including the numerical data of electric energy demand and the geospatial information (as location coordinates) of failed trips. By performing a GIS-based analysis of the results, the derived geospatial data can help state transportation agencies determine where to deploy the charging facilities to satisfy the overall charging demand. The proposed simulation framework offers a novel and strategic way to resolve the challenges for EV charging-related research and projects.",FEB,2023,2677,2,10.1177/03611981221107921,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03611981221107921

Although not the central focus of the review, we consider agent-based modeling of retail high streets against a backdrop of broader debate about downtown vitality and revitalization, amid a climate of economic challenges for brick-and-mortar retail. In particular, we consider how agent-based modeling, supported by insights from consideration of indoor shopping, can provide planning and decision support in outdoor high street settings. Our review considers abstractions of customers through conceptual modeling and customer typology, as well as abstractions of retailing as stationary and mobile. We examine high-level agency of shop choice and selection, as well as low-level agency centered on perception and cognition. Customer journeys are most often trips through geography; we therefore review path-planning, generation of foot traffic, wayfinding, steering, and locomotion. On busy high streets, journeys also manifest within crowd motifs; we thus review proximity, group dynamics, and sociality. Many customer journeys along retail high streets are dynamic, and customers will shift their journeys as they come into contact with experiences and service offerings. To address this, we specifically consider treatment of time and timing in agent-based models. We also examine sites for customer journeys, looking in particular at how agent-based models can provide support for the analysis of atmospherics, artifacts, and location-based services. Finally, we examine staff-side agency, considering store staff as potential agents outdoors; and we look at work to build agent-based models of fraud from customer journey analysis.",JAN,2023,18,1,10.1007/s11403-022-00350-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11403-022-00350-z

A fundamental process that underpins the emergent structure of cities and commuting patterns is location choice with respect to housing and employment. Consequently, location choice models constitute important sub-components of land use-and-transport-interaction (LUTI) and urban growth models. This paper documents the development and application of the Metropolitan Location and Mobility Patterns Simulator (METLOMP-SIM). METLOMP-SIM is a geospatial agent-based model that simulates how urban structure and travel patterns co-emerge, as a function of the location decisions of heterogeneous households and individuals within a spatially-explicit urban context. After specifying a generic conceptual model that identifies the model's structure, entities and agents' decision-making framework, METLOMP-SIM is implemented using the Kumasi Metropolis in Ghana, Sub-Saharan Africa as case study. Overall, the implemented model demonstrates that the encoded micro-scale behaviour of households and individuals are able to mimic some macro-scale residential and job location patterns, and patterns of home-work trip flows that closely match patterns in the case study metropolis. The current model represents property and job market dynamics in both their 'formal' and 'informal' manifestations, making it potentially relevant to dynamic, agent based LUTI model development and applications in Sub-Saharan African cities.",APR,2021,110,,10.1016/j.habitatint.2021.102343,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2021.102343

However, these studies are not typically implemented on real geospatial data to represent the urban environment, and even less frequently compare patterns of segregation between cities. Therefore, the objective of this study is to implement an agent-based model that simulates the decision-making process of immigrants as they arrive and settle in three Canadian gateways for immigration, including the City of Toronto, the City of Calgary, and Metro Vancouver. The resulting simulated spatial patterns of segregation are visually compared to real data representing the location of hotspots of immigrants of various ethnic origins. The degree of segregation is measured and compared, with measures of segregation obtained from actual census data.

The UK depends on informal social care-family members or friends providing care-for some 50% of care provision. However, lower birth rates and a greying population mean that care availability is becoming a significant problem, causing concern among policy-makers that substantial public investment in formal care will be required in decades to come. In this paper, we present an agent-based simulation of care provision in the UK, in which individual agents can decide to provide informal care, or pay for private care, for their loved ones. Agents base these decisions on factors including their own health, employment status, financial resources, relationship to the individual in need and geographical location. Results demonstrate that the model can produce similar patterns of care need and availability as are observed in the real world, despite the model containing minimal empirical data. We propose that our model better captures the complexities of social care provision than other methods, due to the socioeconomic details present and the use of kinship networks to distribute care among family members.",26-Jul,2019,6,7,10.1098/rsos.190029,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.190029

This paper presents an agent-based model named CID-USST (Creative Industries Development-Urban Spatial Structure Transformation) that examines the dynamics of the interaction between the development of creative industries and urban spatial structure by outputting a set of adaptive scenarios through time and space. It reveals that the spatial distribution of both the creative firms and the creative workers evolves in a repeating up-and-down pattern even when the exogenous urban economic condition is set to be steady. Moreover, the analysis also points to the policy implication that more open job/rent market information will lead to more rapid geographical clustering of the creative firms and the creative workers, which possibly may reduce the time cost in their spatial evolvement, and perhaps accelerate innovation if we accept that geographical proximity can enhance knowledge and information spill-over.",APR,2018,55,5,10.1177/0042098016686493,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0042098016686493

As an alternative, complex systems researchers often use agent based models (ABM) or multi-agent systems (NIAS) to model and simulate complexity in human-environmental interactions. This paper briefly reports on the development of a novel cyberinfrastructure portal solution called GeoGames. This computing environment integrates and leverages web-GIS and multiplayer online game technology to enable simulations of real-world scenarios of coupled human and natural systems applicable to anything from cities, urban regions to other human settlements. While there are some similarities between GeoGames and games like SimCity, and Civilization, a fundamental idea underlying the GeoGames approach is the focus on creating an on-line world that mirrors (c.f. Gelemter, 1991) authentic real-world geography, realized by a full range of GIS supported mapping and processing services (Ahlqvist, Loffing, Ramanathan, Kocher, P). In the context of air prototype platform we present the emerging area of Spatial Game Analytics (Drachen & Schubert, 2013) that provides an uncharted area for data-intensive geospatial scenario analysis.

"Chen, Assaf",Spatially explicit modelling of agricultural dynamics in semi-arid environments,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"This paper describes a software package called Spatially Explicit Agricultural Dynamics (SEAD), which investigates agricultural spatial and temporal land-use changes. SEAD is an agent-based model whose rules are set to mimic the human decision making processes regarding agricultural land expansion. Model calibration is based on remotely sensed data. Detection of agricultural lands was executed using intraand inter-annual Landsat images, with an overall accuracy of 86%. An analysis regarding the correlation of agricultural spread with water availability, irrigation infrastructure, road infrastructure, soil type, and geographical variables was conducted. These data, along with interviews with agricultural experts examining farmers' decision-making processes, were translated into rules that were used to model agricultural expansion. The SEAD results show that agricultural expansion in the north-western Negev (Israel) is highly dependent on water availability, which in turn is sensitive to forecasted climate change scenarios. While the spatial expansion patterns are mostly influenced by irrigation and road infrastructure positioning and placement, they vary in their infrastructural costs and agricultural settlement clustering and connectivity, thus affecting landscape fragmentation, travel time, and social/ecological connectivity. SEAD, being highly encapsulated and object-oriented in nature, can be reused in different settings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Four strategies were evaluated, including (i) random sampling of fixed numbers of swine sites monthly; (ii) risk-based sampling of fixed numbers, specifically of breeding sites (high-consequence sites); (iii) risk-based sampling of fixed numbers of low biosecurity sites (high-risk); and (iv) risk-based sampling of breeding sites that are characterized as low biosecurity sites (high-risk/high-consequence). The model simulated transmission of a hypothetical emerging PRRSV strain between swine sites through three important industry networks (production system, truck and feed networks) while considering sites' underlying immunity due to past or recent exposure to heterologous PRRSV strains, as well as demographic, geographic and biosecurity-related PRRS risk factors. Outcomes of interest included surveillance system sensitivity and time to detection of the three first cases over a period of approximately three years. Results: Surveillance system sensitivities were low and time to detection of three first cases was long across all examined scenarios. Conclusion: Traditional modes of implementing high-risk and high-consequence risk-based surveillance based on site's static characteristics do not appear to substantially improve surveillance system sensitivity. Novel strategies need to be developed and considered for rapid detection of this and other emerging swine infectious diseases. None of the four strategies compared herein appeared optimal for early detection of an emerging PPRSV strain at the regional level considering model assumptions, the underlying population of interest, and absence of other forms of surveillance.",12-Jun,2017,13,,10.1186/s12917-017-1091-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-1091-7

Computer simulations can be used to run evacuation models for evaluating different evacuation scenarios. However, developing realistic simulations is a complex task.

We sought to investigate how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccination affected the course of these outbreaks. Methods We used an agent-based model of disease transmission to simulate COVID-19 outbreaks in Nunavut. The model encapsulated demographics and household structure of the population, the effect of NPIs, and daily number of vaccine doses administered. We fitted the model to inferred, back-calculated infections from incidence data reported from October 2020 to June 2021. We then compared the fit of the scenario based on case count data with several counterfactual scenarios without the effect of NPIs, without vaccination, and with a hypothetical accelerated vaccination program whereby 98% of the vaccine supply was administered to eligible individuals. Results We found that, without a territory-wide lockdown during the first COVID-19 outbreak in November 2020, the peak of infections would have been 4.7 times higher with a total of 5,404 (95% CrI: 5,015-5,798) infections before the start of vaccination on January 6, 2021. Without effective NPIs, we estimated a total of 4,290 (95% CrI: 3,880-4,708) infections during the second outbreak under the pace of vaccination administered in Nunavut. In a hypothetical accelerated vaccine rollout, the total infections during the second Nunavut outbreak would have been 58% lower, to 1,812 (95% CrI: 1,593-2,039) infections. Vaccination was estimated to have the largest impact during the outbreak in April 2021, averting 15,196 (95% CrI: 14,798-15,591) infections if the disease had spread through Nunavut communities. Accelerated vaccination would have further reduced the total infections to 243 (95% CrI: 222-265) even in the absence of NPIs.

A sensitivity analysis study is conducted to test the developed model's performance, including different levels of influential model parameters such as targeting non-customers parameters by Loyal/ Unhappy customers.Key results reveal that the best scenario is achieved when the WoM value equals 10, the vehicle number equals 30, and the vehicle speed equals 60 km/h. These model parameters result in higher customer numbers of 873, vehicle utilization equals 63%, and customer satisfaction equals 99%.

Two types of evacuation models are widely used: (i) agent-based modelling (ABM) defines sets of rules that individual agents in a simulation follow during a simulated evacuation; and (ii) geographical information systems (GIS) are more accessible to city planners, but cannot incorporate the dynamic behaviours found in ABMs. The two evacuation modelling methodologies were compared through a case study by assessing the state of evacuation preparedness and investigating potential mitigation options. The two models showed different magnitudes for mortality rates and facility demand but had similar trends. Both models agreed on the best solution to reduce the loss of life for the community.

"Zhang, Jiaxin; Robinson, Derek T.",Investigating path dependence and spatial characteristics for retail success using location allocation and agent-based approaches,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,"Agent-based models (ABMs) have been widely used to represent and investigate complex systems and are a contemporary modelling approach used in the study of land-use change. While many ABMs have been constructed to address research associated with residential land development and human choices, agricultural land transition and farmer decision-making, and transportation networks and planning, less attention has been given to improving our understanding about the drivers and agent behaviours associated with commercial and retail competition, which subsequently affects land-use change. Among existing ABMs that represent the retail system, the focus has been on understanding consumer behaviours, but the inclusion of store competition is lacking, and most retail competition models still use a top-down modelling framework. The presented research contributes to the gap in agent-based models of commercial land use through the development and use of a retail-competition agent-based model (RC-ABM). Utilizing empirical research on consumer expenditures and retail location site selection, competition for home-improvement expenditures is simulated within the Region of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. A model-to-model comparison of the RC-ABM against the historically used location-allocation model showed distributional equivalence. Results exhibit a high level of alignment between the RC-ABM and a traditional Location-Allocation Model (LAM) in estimating market capture and store revenue acquisition. While modelled competition cannot solely reproduce the observed spatial pattern of home-improvement stores in our study area, outcomes identified local market saturation, path-independent areas where store survivability is highest, and the relative influence of store and geographic characteristics on retail success.

However, the process is not always presented successfully due to heterogeneity and inequality in the technological capacities (TC) of the agents that are part of the transfer process, in addition to the geographical context, the interaction networks and decision rules, which are key factors to understand the TT phenomenon. In this context and as a case study, the Colombian National Federation of rice growers promoted the development and adoption of technology that increased crop competitiveness and sustainability by implementing a technology transfer program known as the Massive Technology Adoption Program (AMTEC-Adopcion Masiva de Tecnologia) on rice. With the AMTEC program, average production costs were reduced by 26% (USD 119 per hectare), and it increased average yields by 23% (1.27 tonnes per hectare), which shows the importance of introducing technologies in productive chains in developing countries. This research provides a better understanding of the TT processes, based on the analysis of the interaction dynamics and behaviour patterns between the agents (i.e., generators, intermediaries, or users) in the TT processes.

Research also suggests that patrol officers could make better use of unallocated time if they were to engage in hot spots policing rather than random patrol. Paired with knowledge that police officers have a considerable amount of unallocated patrol time, it may be a relatively untapped resource with substantial crime prevention potential. Methods The present study employs an agent-based model informed by routine activity and rational choice theories to simulate whether significant reductions in street robbery can be achieved if officers increase dosage of police presence at hot spots during their unallocated patrol time rather than randomly patrolling a large geographic area. Results The findings suggest that if departments achieve one-third of a patrol officer's time be dedicated to proactive activities, substantial crime reductions in a large geographic area may be obtained.

Nevertheless, ABMs need to be carefully tuned to achieve the desirable goal of simulating spatiotemporal phenomena of interest, and a well-calibrated model is expected to achieve an improved understanding of the phenomena. To address some of the above challenges, this article proposes an integrated framework of global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and calibration, called GSA-CAL. Specifically, variance-based GSA is applied to identify input parameters with less influence on differences between simulated outputs and observations. By dropping these less influential input parameters in the calibration process, this research reduces the computational intensity of calibration. Since GSA requires many simulation runs, due to ABMs' stochasticity, we leverage the high-performance computing power provided by the advanced cyberinfrastructure. A spatially explicit ABM of influenza transmission is used as the case study to demonstrate the utility of the framework.

Design/methodology/approach The paper leverages the agent-based modeling (ABM) method to model individuals from two aspects, behavior and attitude. Based on the analysis and research of online data, we propose a rumor propagation model, namely the Untouched view transmit removed-Susceptible hesitate agree disagree (Unite-Shad), and devise an immunization strategy, namely the Gravity Immunization Strategy (GIS). A graph-based framework, namely Pregel, is used to carry out the rumor propagation simulation experiments. Through the experiments, the rationality of the Unite-Shad and the effectiveness of the GIS are verified. Findings The study discovers that the inconsistency between human behaviors and attitudes in rumor propagation can be explained by the Unite-shad model. Besides, the GIS, which shows better performance in small-world networks than in scale-free networks, can effectively suppress rumor propagation in the early stage.

Networks are ubiquitous features of human culture. They structure the geographical patterning of the archaeological record strongly. But while material evidence of networked social interaction is abundant (e.g. similarities in artefact types and technologies), preserved physical remains of the networks (such as roads) are much rarer, making it difficult, if not impossible, to understand the spatial structure of cultural exchange and diffusion. This raises the intractably complex problem of optimal physical network reconstruction, based solely on the known locations of archaeological finds or sites. We address the tractable subproblem of plausible reconstruction of network links. Using a small sample set of Late Bronze Age settlement sites in and around the Mediterranean, we explore model-based network reconstruction from sparse and legacy archaeological data. A hierarchical model is provided by a network-adapted version of Renfrew and Level's (1979) classic XTENT formula. We show that a GIS-based implementation, that utilises cost surfaces, offers significantly increased realism and analytical advantages.

Specifically, the model demonstrates how the buying and selling of houses can lead to urban shrinkage through a bottom-up approach. The results of the model indicate that, along with the lower level housing transactions being captured, the aggregated level market conditions relating to urban shrinkage are also denoted (i.e., the contraction of housing markets).

We focused on Sarbaz county in Iran, a malaria-endemic area where the prevalence rate is high. Our ABM, which was carried out in two steps, considers humans and mosquitoes along with their attributes and behaviors as agents, while the environment is made up of diverse environmental factors, namely air temperature, relative humidity, vegetation, altitude, distance from rivers and reservoirs, and population density, the first three of which change over time. As control interventions, we included long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). The simulation results showed that applying LLINs and IRS in combination, rather than separately, was most efficient in reducing the number of infected humans.

It is one of the most important cereal pests. In Brazil, the economic losses associated with this aphid result mainly from the transmission of the barley yellow dwarf viruses. Decision-making for the adoption of management measures must consider the initial population size, the potential for population increase, and the time when this population will reach levels at which the resulting damage is equal to the costs of control measures. Consequently, the establishment of management programmes and decision support systems should be based on models that estimate the potential population growth of this pest species. Temperature is one of the main factors that determine the growth rate of insect populations. Generally, controlled experiments are designed to examine the relationship of temperature at fixed intervals in relation to the development phases of insects. In nature, thermal regimes are not constant, and population growth is the result of a series of combined events. In this work, the effects of different thermal regimes on the population growth ofR. padiwere compared. An agent-based model was used to estimate population growth, and the parameters defined in controlled regimes were compared with fluctuating temperatures under natural conditions.

The prototype model developed was used to generate building evacuation scenarios in order to perform a preliminary assessment of the effects of panic on the egress of building occupants, represented in the model as urgency (increased evacuation speed) and knowledge of exits. In the model, 3DGIS layers of the case study building were used as inputs to model the simulation agents referred to as 'species'. PEOPLE species represents the building occupants evacuating to their target EXIT_POINTS along the INDOOR_PATHS. Their movement is affected by the chance of panic (CoP) and the chance of knowledge of exit (CoKE) parameters. CoP sets the number of PEOPLE agents 'panicking', which would be assigned with movement at 1.5 times the default speed. On the other hand, CoKE conditionally sets the target EXIT_POINT to either the designated exit attribute of the ROOMS where the PEOPLE species is located or to a random exit. Speed of movement along the INDOOR_PATHS is also affected according to path weights which are proportional to the number of PEOPLE species on the same path. Different simulation runs were performed, varying the CoP and CoKE. In general, knowledge of exit only reduced the total egress time slightly, but within the egress period, more people were able to exit quickly with increased knowledge of exit. Shorter egress time can be achieved with a random selection of exits and low CoP. However, as the number of occupants panicking increased, total egress time would eventually increase. The simulation illustrated the limitations of designating exits based on the shortest route only and indicate that knowledge of the volume of evacuating people along the indoor paths is beneficial for improving egress.",3-Jul,2019,23,3,10.1080/12265934.2018.1549505,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/12265934.2018.1549505

By considering routine replication as one kind of template-based activities between different units, we examined interrelations between routines with a NK-based fitness landscape model. Our results show that when there is an appropriate level of absorptive capacities (i.e., when organizations are capable of identifying and acquiring externally generated knowledge), there is an optimal combination of these two types of networks, which is beneficial to routine replicating practices and organization adaptation.

Results from Monte Carlo simulations of an agent-based model,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A,"Cultural diversity is a complex and multi-faceted concept. Commonly used quantitative measures of the spatial distribution of culturally defined groups-such as segregation, isolation or concentration indexes-have been designed to capture just one feature of this distribution. The strengths and weaknesses of such measures under varying demographic, geographic and behavioral conditions can only be comprehensively assessed empirically. This has been rarely done in the case of multigroup cultural diversity. This paper aims to fill this gap and to provide evidence on the empirical properties of various segregation indexes by means of Monte Carlo replications of agent-based modelling simulations under widely varying assumptions. Schelling's classical segregation model is used as the theoretical engine to generate patterns of spatial clustering. The data inputs include the initial population, the assumed geography, the number and shares of various cultural groups, and their preferences with respect to co-location. Our Monte Carlo replications of agent-based modelling data generating process produces output maps that enable us to assess the sensitivity of the various measures of segregation to parameter assumptions by means of response surface analysis. We find that, as our simulated city becomes more diverse, stable residential location equilibria require the preference for co-location with one's own group to be not much more than the group share of the smallest demographic minority. When equilibria exist, the values of the various segregation measures are strongly dependent on the composition of the population across cultural groups, the assumed preferences and the assumed geography. Index values are generally non-decreasing in increasing preference for within-group co-location. More diverse populations yield-for given preferences and geography-a greater degree of spatial clustering.

Previous research has shown that factors such as homophily, population size, geography, mass media, and type of social influence play important roles. In the present paper, we investigate for the first time the impact that institutions have on cultural diversity. In our first three studies, we extend existing agent-based models and explore the effects of institutional influence and agent loyalty. We find that higher institutional influence increases cultural diversity, while individuals' loyalty to their institutions has a small, preserving effect. In three further studies, we test how bottom-up and top-down processes of institutional influence impact our model. We find that bottom-up democratic practices, such as referenda, tend to produce convergence towards homogeneity, while top-down information dissemination practices, such as propaganda, further increase diversity. In our last model-an integration of bottom-up and topdown processes into a feedback loop of information-we find that when democratic processes are rare, the effects of propaganda are amplified, i.e., more diversity emerges; however, when democratic processes are common, they are able to neutralize or reverse this propaganda effect. Importantly, our models allow for control over the full spectrum of diversity, so that a manipulation of our parameters can result in preferred levels of diversity, which will be useful for the study of other factors in the future.

Three scenarios and four hypotheses were used in the simulation to test the impact of different policies on the attractiveness of industrial estates. Policies were distinguished by the level of municipal coordination at which they were implemented and by the type of intervention. In the model, the attractiveness of industrial estates was based on the level of facilities, amenities, accessibility and on the price of land in each industrial estate. Firms are able to move and relocate whenever they find an attractive estate. The relocating firms were selected by their size, location and distance to an industrial estate. Results show that a coordinated policy among municipalities is the most efficient policy to promote advanced-qualified estates.

Agent behavior is formally specified to illustrate the daily activities of diverse population types, and particularly the model observes how many agents pass by commercial buildings of interest. With the described model, we performed a virtual experiment that examines the strengths of factors in negatively influencing the city commerce.

There are four key issues to implement a parallel agent-based Schelling model, i.e., the ability to handle (1) the complexity of real data processing; (2) spatial data decomposition; (3) the preference and tolerance rates for multiple ethnic groups; and (4) the communication between agents. A new parallel algorithm that addresses these issues while retaining the fundamental concepts of the original sequential Schelling model was built. The parallel Schelling model was applied to the County of San Diego's one million household agents and one million housing unit agents using land use data and 2000 Decennial Census data. Experiments using varying numbers of CPU cores demonstrate that the computational performance of the parallel Schelling model positively correlates with increased numbers of CPU cores. This paper focuses on the implementation of a parallel agent-based Schelling model. The Schelling model is parallelized to illustrate how high-performance computing can elicit better understanding of real-world geospatial phenomena. By leveraging distributed computing resources in geospatial cyberinfrastructure, the parallel Schelling model has the potential to become a crucial component in spatial decision support systems and to help policy makers understand the key trends in urban population, urban growth, and residential segregation.

Beyond the question of geographical distribution, where the answer is most certainly yes, when looked at from a mathematical viewpoint the scoring process during a match can be thought of, in a first approximation, as being modeled by a Poisson distribution. Recently, it was shown that the scoring of real tournaments can be reproduced by means of an agent-based model (da Silva et al. (2013) [24]) based on two simple hypotheses: (i) the ability of a team to win a match is given by the rate of a Poisson distribution that governs its scoring during a match; and (ii) such ability evolves over time according to results of previous matches. In this article we are interested in the question of whether the time series represented by the scores of teams have universal properties. For this purpose we define a distance between two teams as the square root of the sum of squares of the score differences between teams over all rounds in a double-round-robin-system and study how this distance evolves over time. Our results suggest a universal distance distribution of tournaments of different major leagues which is better characterized by an exponentially modified Gaussian (EMG). This result is corroborated by our agent-based model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",15-Mar,2014,398,,10.1016/j.physa.2013.12.008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2013.12.008

Within this tendency, there has been a marked uptick in risk to urban crossers who are neither children nor elderly. The age group in between these extremes represents a bulk of urban crossers, for whom theoretical explanations for crossing behavior that are focused on youth and senior crossing factors often do not apply. New insight is likely required to explain why the rate of crossing harm is growing for the 20-44 age group, but declining among the young and elderly. However, it is difficult to experiment with crossing scenarios in a real-world context, where significant dangers are present and for which the uniqueness of crossers and crossing sites is abundant. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end system for examining crossing behavior using a unique combination of real human crossing behavior, made safe through the combination of agent-based models, motion capture, virtual geographic environments, and immersive technologies from virtual reality. We demonstrate that this combination of methods can be deployed to examine very high resolution and very high specificities of crossing scenarios and behaviors, with reach to individual crossers and their judgment over tiny windows of space and time. We demonstrate that the system can reproduce known effects from the theoretical literature and from existing case studies, while also generating huge swaths of empirical and diagnostically useful data on crossing actions, interactions, and reactions relative to fleeting events and phenomena of urban geography, traffic dynamics, and ambient pedestrian crowds.

However, these standard games often examine isolated interactions among individuals, leading to varying results based on factors such as the population studied, number of participants, and geographical context. Consequently, the understanding of cooperation evolution remains imprecise. To address this limitation, we are trying to generalize these experimental studies, we employ an agent-based model in this study to simulate interactions in public goods game and explore the influence of punishment and reward on the evolution of cooperation. Unlike standard games, evolutionary games offer a more comprehensive framework to capture and analyze a broader range of strategic interactions and behaviors. In our approach, we introduce two methods for applying punishment or reward: Individual Punishment or Reward and Collective Punishment or Reward. Under the first method, actors can individually reward or punish each other based on their contributions or free-riding behavior towards the collective good. In the second method, decisions for punishment or reward are made collectively after achieving a consensus or agreement among the members of the group. We provide a model for comparing Individual Decision Rule and Collective Decision Rule under punishment and reward, to study their effects on the evolution of contributions. Consistent with recent experimental findings, our results indicate that these mechanisms lead to a significant increase in contributions compared to the outcomes observed in standard public goods game.

In this study, an agent-based model for the simulation of pedestrian evacuation during earthquakes at the city scale is developed following an interdisciplinary approach. The model recreates the urban conditions using Geographic Information System (GIS) and a synthetic population, in addition to the earthquake consequences on the urban fabric. Moreover, the model integrates realistic human behaviors calibrated using quantitative survey results. We simulate pedestrian outdoor mobility with the different constraints that affect it such as the topography and the presence of debris. The simulator is applied to the case of Beirut, Lebanon. A what-if approach is adopted to analyze the population's safety in case of earthquakes in Beirut, particularly the open spaces' capacity to provide shelters and the effect of debris and realistic human behaviors on people's safety. The simulation results show that less than 40% of the population is able to arrive at an open space within 15 min after an earthquake. This number is further reduced when some open spaces are locked.

It employs an agent-based model at the individual level in Gorgan, northeast Iran, characterized by diverse spatial and demographic features. The interactions between human agents and their environment were considered by incorporating social activities based on different urban land uses. The proposed model was integrated with the susceptible-asymptomatic-symptomatic-on treatment-aggravated infection-recovered-dead epidemic model to better understand the disease transmission at the micro-level. The effect of various intervention scenarios, such as social distancing, complete and partial lockdowns, restriction of social gatherings, and vaccination was investigated. The model was evaluated in three modes of cases, deaths, and the spatial distribution of COVID-19. The results show that the disease was more concentrated in central areas with a high population density and dense urban land use. The proposed model predicted the distribution of disease cases and mortality for different age groups, achieving 72% and 71% accuracy, respectively. Additionally, the model was able to predict the spatial distribution of disease cases at the neighborhood level with 86% accuracy. Moreover, findings demonstrated that early implementation of control scenarios, such as social distancing and vaccination, can effectively reduce the transmission of COVID-19 spread and control the epidemic.

To accomplish this, we first develop a methodology for distinguishing between different types of polarization. This enables a more nuanced investigation into the interplay between behavior online and behavior offline. We next expand on the public-private split model by introducing a novel virtual worlds framework for representing an online social media platform. Agents from the neighbor-constrained real world can log-in to these virtual worlds with a certain probability and participate in a complete network; this reflects the unique socioeconomic and geographic anonymity provided through social media. Additionally, global homophilic influence is incorporated and its relationship with local virtual world structure is considered. We finally perform a sensitivity analysis over a set of model parameters, and find that the incorporation of virtual worlds can result in the simultaneous presence of different types of polarization in the real and virtual worlds.

Given the influence on the system resilience of several parameters such as the number and distribution of CAVs, the initial geographic distribution of the injured and the spatiotemporal evolution of the functionality of the integrated hospital-road networks, a multi agent-based modelling (ABM) framework has been established to identify relevant patterns and bottlenecks in injured transfers across hazard-impacted urban communities. In such an ABM framework, each individual vehicle, transferring an injured inhabitant, is modelled as an inde-pendent agent, whose traveling is shaped by pre-defined behavioral attributes, while the inter-play among those agents is also considered, throughout the entire transfer campaign. Based on a hypothetically catastrophic earthquake scenario, such an ABM framework is employed to model the city-scale, post-shock transfer across Tangshan city, located in one of the most earthquake -prone regions of China. The simulation outcome reveals that the information sharing with regard to the real-time functionality of the local hospital system plays a strategically crucial role, to the avoidance of uncoordinated and prolonged transfers.

Cities offer spatial economic advantages that boost agglomeration forces and innovation, fostering further concentration of economic activities. For historic reasons urban centers cluster along coasts, which are prone to climate-induced flooding and sea level rise. To explore trade-offs between agglomeration economies and hazards increasing with climate change, we develop an evolutionary agent-based model with heterogeneous boundedly-rational agents who learn and adapt to a changing environment. The model combines migration decision of both households and firms between safe Inland and hazard-prone Coastal regions with endogenous technological learning and economic growth. Flood damages affect Coastal firms hitting their labour productivity, capital stock and inventories. We find that the model is able to replicate a rich set of micro- and macro-empirical regularities concerning economic and spatial dynamics. Without climate-induced shocks, the model shows how lower transport costs favour the Coastal region fueling the self-reinforcing and path-dependent agglomeration processes. We then introduce five scenarios of floods characterized by different frequency and severity to study the complex interplay of hazards with agglomeration patterns affecting the performance of the overall economy. We find that when shocks are mild or infrequent, they negatively affect the economic performance of the economy. If strong flood hazards hit frequently the Coastal region before agglomeration forces trigger high levels of the waterfront urbanization, firms and households can timely adapt and migrate landwards, thus averting the adverse impacts of climate shocks on the whole economy. Conversely, in the presence of climate tipping points where the frequency and magnitude of flood hazards abruptly intensifies, we find that economic activities remain trapped in the hazardprone region, generating lock-ins and leading to a harsh downturn of the overall economy.",DEC,2022,202,,10.1016/j.ecolecon.2022.107588,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2022.107588

In this study, we aimed to overcome this issue by considering a community as a heterogeneous group under flood risk via geographically explicit agent-based modeling. This method allowed us to computationally experiment on how human-flood interactions are conditioned by vari-ations in household-level attributes and governmental support. Specifically, our study considered the community-based flood protection system in the Ganges-Brahmaputra River basin in Bangladesh. Our results suggest that heterogeneities in the geographic location, income, and flood damage have significant effects on the outcome of human-flood interactions, specifically cooperative efforts toward minimizing flood damage and maintaining flood protection structures. Our results also highlight that a moderate level of governmental support (i.e., assisting with only a part of the required labor) is necessary to maintain the infrastructure built to promote cooperative action in a community-scale flood protection system.

We then evaluate the potential effect of an eruption of Vesuvius volcano on the spread of COVID-19 in Campania, Italy. Results In a majority of cases, the occurrence of a natural disaster increases the number of disease related fatalities. For a natural disaster fifty days after infection onset, the median increase in fatalities is 2, 59, and 180% for a 2, 14, and 31-day long natural disaster respectively, when compared to the no natural disaster scenario.

"Overwater, Arnold; Yorke-Smith, Neil",Agent-based simulation of short-term peer-to-peer rentals: Evidence from the Amsterdam housing market,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE,"Gentrification, displacement and social exclusion are hot topics of debate in the city of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. A current phenomena is short-term rentals of private homes. In its peer-to-peer form, this phenomena has grown sharply, facilitated by services such as Airbnb. Its growth has caused controversies among communities in touristic areas of Amsterdam, since it contributes to a changed social fabric, increased housing prices and overall gentrification. In the Netherlands and elsewhere, municipal and national policy makers are interested to regulate short-term rentals. In order to provide insights into qualitative policy effects, we develop a micro-level agent-based simulation. Our spatial model simulates residential migration based on income and house pricing. The underlying economic theory is that of Smith's rent-gap hypothesis. Our model is among the first agent-based approaches investigating this type of rental market, and the first to model a specific housing market, including social housing, in a geographically accurate way. Simulation analysis shows that the touristic rental market has caused considerable changes in housing prices and population development. We find that more lower income citizens remain in the city centre when regulation of the market is stronger, and that banning the touristic market restrains the overall increase in house prices, compared to the business-as-usual scenario. However, the feasibility of enforcement of regulation, and its libertarian consequences, must be considered.",JAN,2022,49,1,10.1177/23998083211000747,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/23998083211000747

In our previous work we established the quantity of orders that can be delivered using electric vans; in this paper we focus on the punctuality of the delivery. We present a baseline agent-based model imitating the operations of a real-world retailer. We then introduce electric vans into our model in order to ascertain how charging power and charging strategy influence the retailer's operations. Even though electric vans cannot match the performance of diesel vehicles using the same fleet size, our simulation experiments suggest that, by considering the quantity of orders and the geographical distribution of its customers, an operator can determine a suitable charging strategy that can minimise late delivery. Additionally, by employing a suitable charging strategy, an operator might avoid making unnecessary investments and reduce the barriers for electric vehicle adoption.",APR,2021,148,,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102269,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2021.102269
"Johnson, Leigh F.; Kubjane, Mmamapudi; Eaton, Jeffrey W.",Challenges in estimating HIV prevalence trends and geographical variation in HIV prevalence using antenatal data: Insights from mathematical modelling,PLOS ONE,"Background HIV prevalence data among pregnant women have been critical to estimating HIV trends and geographical patterns of HIV in many African countries. Although antenatal HIV prevalence data are known to be biased representations of HIV prevalence in the general population, mathematical models have made various adjustments to control for known sources of bias, including the effect of HIV on fertility, the age profile of pregnant women and sexual experience. Methods and findings We assessed whether assumptions about antenatal bias affect conclusions about trends and geographical variation in HIV prevalence, using simulated datasets generated by an agent-based model of HIV and fertility in South Africa. Results suggest that even when controlling for age and other previously-considered sources of bias, antenatal bias in South Africa has not been constant over time, and trends in bias differ substantially by age. Differences in the average duration of infection explain much of this variation. We propose an HIV duration-adjusted measure of antenatal bias that is more stable, which yields higher estimates of HIV incidence in recent years and at older ages. Simpler measures of antenatal bias, which are not age-adjusted, yield estimates of HIV prevalence and incidence that are too high in the early stages of the HIV epidemic, and that are less precise. Antenatal bias in South Africa is substantially greater in urban areas than in rural areas. Conclusions Age-standardized approaches to defining antenatal bias are likely to improve precision in model-based estimates, and further recency adjustments increase estimates of HIV incidence in recent years and at older ages. Incompletely adjusting for changing antenatal bias may explain why previous model estimates overstated the early HIV burden in South Africa. New assays to estimate the fraction of HIV-positive pregnant women who are recently infected could play an important role in better estimating antenatal bias.",20-Nov,2020,15,11,10.1371/journal.pone.0242595,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242595

Agent-based models are flexible and allow for a wide variety of behaviors, time-related variables, and geographies, making the calibration process an extremely important step in model development. Such calibration procedures, including verification and validation, may be complicated, however, and usually require incorporation of substantial empirical data and theoretical knowledge of the populations and processes under study. This paper describes steps taken to build and calibrate an agent-based model of epidemic spread in an early 20th century fishing village in Newfoundland and Labrador, including a description of some of the detailed ethnographic and historical data available. We illustrate how these data were used to develop the structure of specific parts of the model. The resulting model, however, is designed to reflect a generic small community during the early 20th century and the spread of a directly transmitted disease within such a community, not the specific place that provided the data. Following the description of model development, we present the results of a replication study used to confirm the model behaves as intended. This study is also used to identify the number of simulations necessary for high confidence in average model output. We also present selected results from extensive sensitivity analyses to assess the effect that variation in parameter values has on model outcomes.

The choice set is selected from an exhaustive set of links and presumably contains those investment options that best meet private operator's objectives by balancing the revenues of additional fare against construction costs. The investment options consist of geographically plausible routes with potential detours. These routes are generated using a fine-meshed regularly latticed network and shortest path finding methods.

Tools commonly employed to implement spatial simulation models include code libraries and pre-compiled models; the former require advanced programming skills while the latter impose relevant constraints on application scope. Previous attempts to produce domain specific languages in the field have invariably resulted in new textual programming languages (e.g. SELES, NetLogo, Ocelet) that are platform specific and in some cases with weak GIS support and interoperability. DSL3S synthesises relevant concepts of spatial simulation in a UML profile, that allows the design of simulation models through the arrangement of graphical elements. An implementation of this language is also presented, that relies on Model Driven Development (MDD) tools distributed with the Eclipse IDE.

In 2007, Lim, Metzler, and Bar-Yam proposed an agent-based model that takes as input the ethnic map of a country and derives from it the predicted locations of ethnic violence. The model rests on the assumption that spatial group clusters of a certain critical size are most likely to display ethnic violence.

We show that their analysis suffers from a biased selection of groups and regions, and that the null hypothesis and unit of analysis are inadequate.

Existing studies generally focused on specific/individual GI practices, potentially overlooking the broader benefits or values of comprehensive GI plans that generally are interconnected networks of multiple GI practices. Thus, this paper developed an agent-based model to offer municipalities, planners, and decision makers a structured and systematic modeling approach to: (1) simulate the dynamic nature of GI implementation plans across spatial and temporal dimensions; (2) capture the interplay among regulations that govern GI plans; and (3) conduct scenario and sensitivity analyses to gain deeper insights into the various characteristics of GI plans under different scenarios. The proposed model considered different economic values of GI plans, including stormwater management, carbon sequestration, pollutant removal, energy cost savings, and increased property value, as well as the social values, such as the positive impact on nearby residents/communities. In addition, the developed model considered the following six GI practices: green roofs, rain gardens, community gardens, bioswales, permeable playgrounds, and permeable pavements. These GI practices were modeled across five submodels: school greening, private property greening, park greening, right-of-way property greening, and public housing properties greening. Scenario analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of financial limitations (i.e., funding priorities) on the model's behavior under two scenarios. Finally, the developed model was statistically validated. The results showed that increasing the number of GIs does not guarantee an increase in their economic value, but rather the implementation of GIs should be well planned according to a priority plan. The findings also provided valuable insights into the importance of considering physical and institutional limitations.

While existing energy transition literature emphasizes the role of government policy and technological innovation, little has been written to integrate top-down approaches encompassing government policy and bottom-up individual enterprise-level decisions. Therefore, here we develop a hybrid top-down, bottom-up production consumption model towards intra-national energy transition planning using a decentralized agent-based approach, including a detailed geographic coverage utilizing GIS to map individual energy units. This enables considering SC-level dynamics of end-users pursuing economic objectives subject to regulatory constraints. Two different case studies are reported.

"Wozniak, Marcin",From dawn to dusk: daily fluctuations in pedestrian traffic in the city center,SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL,"Pedestrian traffic in a city is subject to fluctuations throughout the day due to a variety of factors. The understanding of these variations can be achieved using properly calibrated agent-based simulation models that capture the dynamics of pedestrian movement. However, despite their significance, such models are currently underrepresented in scientific discussions. In addition, acquiring real-world pedestrian localization data for model calibration poses challenges. To address these issues, this paper presents an agent-based model specifically designed to examine pedestrian traffic fluctuations at a mesoscale level. The model uses popular times data from the Google Places service and population data from the Geographic Information System (GIS) for accurate calibration. As a result, it effectively captures the real-world dynamics of pedestrian movement in the city center. By harnessing the advantages of agent-based modeling (ABM), the model generates several valuable insights into daily pedestrian traffic. It estimates the capacity and speed of pedestrian flows and determines the daily load within the simulated area. Moreover, it enables the identification of bottlenecks and areas characterized by varying levels of pedestrian density. The model's validation process involves comparing its output with empirical studies and pedestrian traffic data from selected points of interest (POIs). The model successfully captures key aspects associated with fundamental diagrams of pedestrian flow. Furthermore, the dynamics of pedestrians closely align with Google Places popular times data for the chosen POIs.

A major challenge in forecasting the transmission of COVID-19 is the accurate assessment of the multiscale human mobility and how it impacts infection through close contacts. By combining the stochastic agent-based modeling strategy and hierarchical structures of spatial containers corresponding to the notion of geographical places, this study proposes a novel model, Mob-Cov, to study the impact of human traveling behavior and individual health conditions on the disease outbreak and the probability of zero-COVID in the population. Specifically, individuals perform power law-type local movements within a container and global transport between different-level containers. It is revealed that frequent long-distance movements inside a small-level container (e.g., a road or a county) and a small population size reduce both the local crowdedness and disease transmission. It takes only half of the time to induce global disease outbreaks when the population increases from 150 to 500 (normalized unit). When the exponent c(1) of the longtail distribution of distance k moved in the same-level container, p(k) similar to k (-c1 center dot level), increases, the outbreak time decreases rapidly from 75 to 25 (normalized unit). In contrast, travel between large-level containers (e.g., cities and nations) facilitates global spread of the disease and outbreak. When the mean traveling distance across containers 1/d increases from 0.5 to 1 (normalized unit), the outbreak occurs almost twice as fast. Moreover, dynamic infection and recovery in the population are able to drive the bifurcation of the system to a zero-COVID state or to a live with COVID state, depending on the mobility patterns, population number and health conditions. Reducing population size and restricting global travel help achieve zero-COVID-19. Specifically, when c(1) is smaller than 0.2, the ratio of people with low levels of mobility is larger than 80% and the population size is smaller than 400, zero-COVID can be achieved within fewer than 1000 time steps. In summary, the Mob-Cov model considers more realistic human mobility at a wide range of spatial scales, and has been designed with equal emphasis on performance, low simulation cost, accuracy, ease of use and flexibility.

This study uses a multi-agent model to investigate the impact of four types of contact tracing strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Methods: In order to analyse individual contact tracing in a reasonably realistic setup, we construct an agent-based model of a small municipality with about 60.000 inhabitants (nodes) and about 2.8 million social contacts (edges) in 30 different layers. Those layers reflect demographic, geographic, sociological and other patterns of the TTWA (Travel-to-work-area) Hodonin in Czechia. Various data sources such as census, land register, transport data or data reflecting the shopping behaviour, were employed to meet this purpose. On this multi-graph structure we run a modified SEIR model of the COVID-19 dynamics. The parameters of the model are calibrated on data from the outbreak in the Czech Republic in the period March to June 2020. The simplest type of contact tracing follows just the family, the second tracing version tracks the family and all the work contacts, the third type finds all contacts with the family, work contacts and friends (leisure activities). The last one is a complete (digital) tracing capable of recalling any and all contacts. We evaluate the performance of these contact tracing strategies in four different environments. First, we consider an environment without any contact restrictions (benchmark); second with strict contact restriction (replicating the stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions employed in Czechia in the spring 2020); third environment, where the measures were substantially relaxed, and, finally an environment with weak contact restrictions and superspreader events (replicating the situation in Czechia in the summer 2020).Findings: There are four main findings in our paper. 1. In general, local closures are more effective than any type of tracing. 2. In an environment with strict contact restrictions there are only small differences among the four contact tracing strategies. 3. In an environment with relaxed contact restrictions the effectiveness of the tracing strategies differs substantially. 4. In the presence of superspreader events only complete contact tracing can stop the epidemic.Interpretation: In situations, where many other non-pharmaceutical interventions are in place, the specific extent of contact tracing may not have a large influence on their effectiveness. In a more relaxed setting with few contact restrictions and larger events the effectiveness of contact tracing depends heavily on their extent.",JUN,2023,43,,10.1016/j.epidem.2023.100677,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2023.100677

Methods to assess the spatiotemporal magnitude of UPFS and their impacts are needed to research and explore mitigation measures. This study presents a method for the assessment of UPFs and their impacts by combining a hydrodynamic sewer system model with a GIS-based overland diffusive flow algorithm. The algorithm is implemented in the software GIS-based Agent-based Modeling Architecture (GAMA) along with the depth-damage functions and land use data to estimate financial impacts. The result is a dynamic and interactive model that allows the user to monitor the events in real-time. Functionality is demonstrated in a case study in Dresden, Germany and with ten to 100-year design storms. The majority of flood extents and damages occur in the early stages of the event. Sewer surcharge emerges from few of the manholes, suggesting early action vitally reduces flood risks and interventions at a few hot spots, largely reducing impacts. Flood protection barriers were interactively implemented as a potential response measure in the hot spot areas reducing the damage by up to 90%.

The framework has use cases and implications for policymakers and renewable generators alike, and can be used by developers to prepare bidding strategy and for policymakers to empirically test auction design. The model is demonstrated through replication of the offshore wind CfD Allocation Round 3 (AR3) pot, and utilises high-level cost modelling distribution data to estimate bid prices for the competing projects. The model produces a distribution of most likely results which better categorises uncertainty, and through comparison of AR3 and simulation results, demonstrates how outcomes can be predicted with reasonable confidence by developers. Analysis show that the transmission network and grid connection charges are a significant barrier for projects in some geographical regions to be awarded a CfD contract, potentially hindering renewable deployment in those areas. Moreover, this paper demonstrates how players can use probability theory to select an optimum bidding strategy which maximises expected profit while factoring the uncertainty inherent in CfD auctions. Results show that a 1200 MW wind farm development can increase potential profits by 135 pound million over the CfD contract length in exchange for a 25 p.p. chance reduction in being awarded a subsidy.",15-Mar,2023,334,,10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.120645,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.120645

The main goals of this study were to simulate and understand the spatial dynamics of COVID-19 spread and assess the efficacy of two policy measures in Montreal, Canada, to mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak. We simulated the COVID-19 outbreak using a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based agent-based model (ABM) and two management scenarios as follows: (1) human mobility reduction; and (2) observation of self-isolation. The ABM description followed the ODD (Overview, Design concepts, Details) protocol. Our simulation experiments indicated that the mainstream of COVID-19 transmissions (i.e., approximately 90.34%) occurred in public places. Besides, the results indicated that the rules aiming to reduce population mobility, led to a reduction of about 63 infected people each week, on average. Furthermore, our scenarios revealed that if instead of 42% (i.e., the adjusted value in the calibration), 10%, 20%, and 30% of infectious people had followed the self-isolation measure, the number of infected people would have risen by approximately 259, 207, and 83 more each week, on average, respectively.

Spatial theory, as well as the model's design, suggest that adequate validation requires multiple tests rather than relying solely on a single test-statistic. A pattern-oriented modeling approach was employed that first mapped real and simulated citizen comments across the US Census tract. The suite of spatial tests included Global Moran's I, complemented with bivariate correlations, as well as the local indicators of spatial association (LISA) test. The global tests showed the model explained up to 65% of the variation in the historical data for US Census tract-level citizen comments on a locally unwanted land use. These global tests were also found helpful to inform the model's calibration for the current application. The LISA results were even stronger, showing that the model predicted citizen comment clustering correctly in five of six Census tracts. It slightly over predicted comments further away from the land use.

"Sarmiento, Leonardo; Foerster, Anna",TRAILS mobility model,SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL,"According to state-of-the-art research, mobile network simulation is preferred over real testbeds, especially to evaluate communication protocols used in Opportunistic Networks (OppNet) or Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANET). The main reason behind it is the difficulty of performing experiments in real scenarios. However, in a simulation, a mobility model is required to define users' mobility patterns. Trace-based models can be used for this purpose, but they are difficult to obtain, and they are not flexible or scalable. Another option is TRAce-based ProbabILiStic (TRAILS). TRAILS mimics the spatial dependency, geographic restrictions, and temporal dependency from real scenarios. In addition, with TRAILS, it is possible to scale the number of mobile users and simulation time. In this paper, we dive into the algorithms used by TRAILS to generate mobility graphs from real scenarios and simulate human mobility. In addition, we compare mobility metrics of TRAILS simulations, real traces, and another synthetic mobility model such as Small Worlds in Motion (SWIM). Finally, we analyze the performance of an implementation of the TRAILS model in computation time and memory consumption. We observed that TRAILS simulations represent the interaction among users of real scenarios with higher accuracy than SWIM simulations. Furthermore, we found that a simulation with TRAILS requires less computation time than a simulation with real traces and that a TRAILS graph consumes less memory than traces.",APR,2023,99,4,10.1177/00375497221133847,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00375497221133847

The model treats the populations of cells and authorities of districts as agents, such that the former can reduce their economic activity and the latter can recommend economic activity reduction both with the overall goal to slow down the epidemic spreading. The agents make decisions with the aim of attaining as high socio-economic standings as possible relative to other agents of the same type by evaluating their standings based on the local and regional infection rates, compliance to the authorities' regulations, regional drops in economic activity, and efforts to mitigate the spread of epidemic. We find that the willingness of population to comply with authorities' recommendations has the most drastic effect on the epidemic spreading: periodic waves spread almost unimpeded in non-compliant populations, while in compliant ones the spread is minimal with chaotic spreading pattern and significantly lower infection rates. Health and economic concerns of agents turn out to have lesser roles, the former increasing their efforts and the latter decreasing them. (C) 2022 The Authors.

Therefore, the eastern civilization (China) can be deemed as a unified culture. In the geographical scope of China in East Asia, there is a stable and continuous history process of one-by-one unified dynasties (empires). Between two old and new unified dynasties in the history of China, there are always chaotic (transitional) periods when several local regimes competed for the absolute power of China (the Mandate of Heaven). In these transitional periods, wars and annexations are always inevitable. Then, only one local regime will succeed in gaining that power, forming a new unified dynasty (empire). The cultural pattern is obviously different in the western world, and there are no stable unification patterns. In Europe, there were also chaotic periods, with wars and annexations. However, there is no stable pattern of unification, which means that no local regimes (countries) have unified mainland Europe. Hence, whether this process can be modeled and revealed? We believe that computational methods can reveal some laws and rules of historical dynamics. For this work, we need to solve the conditions of both the unity and disunity. To achieve this goal: first, we build an agent-based model of general history dynamics for the chaotic periods; second, we run the simulations to explore outcomes of the unity and disunity; last, we obtain valid solutions for both the unity of China and the disunity of the West world. It suggests that our valid solutions explain the disunity between China and Europe patterns. Moreover, we can calculate the conditional boundaries of both unity (China) and disunity (Europe). Thus, the unification process in human history may be universal, but the outcomes or patterns may be different under different conditions.",OCT,2022,14,10,10.1007/s12520-022-01650-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12520-022-01650-y

This challenge is greater when agents face complex economic decisions that depend on the state of the landscape and the actions of other agents. We address this complexity by developing an agent-based model, founded on standard economic theory, that defines household production and utility functions for millions of spatially-explicit economic agents. Inter-agent competition is directly modeled by defining how NTFP extraction of one agent changes the extraction efficiency and travel-time of nearby agents, thereby modifying agents' profit functions and utility maximization. We demonstrate our simulation using Tanzania as a case study. Our application relies on estimates of NTFP stocks, local wages, and traversal times across a landscape network of grid-cells, which we derive using geospatial and household data. The results of our simulation provide spatially explicit and aggregate estimates of NTFP extraction and household profit. Our model provides a methodological advance for studies that require understanding the impacts of conservation policies on households that rely on natural capital from forests.

Suitability scores were generated for individual property parcels using criteria weights derived from surveyed retail-industry experts. To increase capacity for site selection, distributions of suitability scores were generated at census dissemination areas (populations 500-700; n = 19,963) and census metropolitan and agglomeration areas (core populations >10,000; n = 43). Analogues among metropolitan and agglomeration areas were generated and spatial clustering was used to identify groups of highly-suitable parcels within urban areas. Lastly, individual parcels can be interrogated for overall suitability or individual criteria scores. Our approach combines retail methods typically used in isolation (e.g. location quotient, Huff's model, network analysis) and demonstrates how a simple survey can be used to weight criteria. Results show that survey respondents were in general agreement and that top-line revenues were more critical to perceived location success than development and operational costs.

We used trait-based evolutionary ecological agent-based modelling to understand how dispersal, selection, extirpation, and other factors contribute to resilience under three climate change scenarios to test the extent to which high dispersal rate contributes to persistence of species and the extent to which they occupy large geographic ranges on an evolutionary time-scale involving speciation, dispersal, gene flow, and extinction. Location Hesperia (an imaginary continent with controlled environmental heterogeneity). Major taxa studied Modelled mammalian herbivore clade with 16 terminal species, each of which is a metapopulation with a variable number of local populations. Methods We used NetLogo to model trait-based biotic responses to climate change in an environmentally heterogeneous continent in an evolving clade, the species of which are each represented by local populations that disperse and interbreed; they also are subject to selection, genetic drift, and local extirpation. We simulated mammalian herbivores, whose success depends on tooth crown height, vegetation type, precipitation and grit. Results We found that high dispersal probability usually allowed species to successfully track their ancestral habitat as the continent's geography was altered by climate change. However, tracking was insufficient to allow species' traits to adapt to novel habitats that arose through the climate change process. High dispersal rates combined with moderate plasticity (lower extirpation risk) facilitated occupation of novel habitats, as did weak selective regimes. Main conclusions The interaction between dispersal, probability of local extirpation, and selection intensity were jointly required to understand the likelihood of species survival and how widespread they would be. Diversity and geographic occupancy were maximized when parameters facilitated evolutionary adaptation to novel habitats. High rates of dispersal were sufficient for habitat tracking but insufficient by themselves to allow occupation of newly emerged environments.",JUN,2022,31,6,10.1111/geb.13495,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.13495

This is particularly important when the abundance or spatial distribution of the stock varies through time. This is best achieved when management objectives and strategies align, and there is coordinated decision-making and catch accounting among jurisdictions such that each fish stock is managed over its full geographic range. However, legal constraints or differing management objectives may not permit such coordinated decision making and policy development. This study introduces a framework for effectively simulating fleet dynamics, fishery quota allocation, and the implications of alternative management strategies while allowing for determination of economically optimal management approaches at the community level. As a case study, an agent-based model (ABM) was developed to examine the interplay between transboundary management scenarios on the economic viability of a nascent Alaska state-waters trawl fishery for walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) in the Gulf of Alaska, given a longstanding federally managed fishery. Under conditions characteristic of the recent past, the management strategy that produced the best overall improvements, relative to status quo, involved a scenario that allows for community-based cooperatives in federal-waters and an open access strategy in state-waters. This case study allows us to demonstrate more generally how using an ABM allows for quantifying the impacts of and informing managers on anticipated, and novel, results of alternative management strategies for complex socioecological systems before implementation. Recommendations for Resource Managers Agent-based modeling provides a method to realistically simulate fleet behavior within a fishery.

"Sage, Lucas; Flache, Andreas",Can Ethnic Tolerance Curb Self-Reinforcing School Segregation? A Theoretical Agent Based Model,JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION,"Schelling and Sakoda prominently proposed computational models suggesting that strong ethnic residential segregation can be the unintended outcome of a self-reinforcing dynamic driven by choices of individuals with rather tolerant ethnic preferences. There are only few attempts to apply this view to school choice, another important arena in which ethnic segregation occurs. In the current paper, we explore with an agent-based theoretical model similar to those proposed for residential segregation, how ethnic tolerance among parents can affect the level of school segregation. More specifically, we ask whether and under which conditions school segregation could be reduced if more parents hold tolerant ethnic preferences. We move beyond earlier models of school segregation in three ways. First, we model individual school choices using a random utility discrete choice approach. Second, we vary the pattern of ethnic segregation in the residential context of school choices systematically, comparing residential maps in which segregation is unrelated to parents' level of tolerance to residential maps reflecting their ethnic preferences. Third, we introduce heterogeneity in tolerance levels among parents belonging to the same group. Our simulation experiments suggest that ethnic school segregation can be a very robust phenomenon, occurring even when about half of the population prefers segregated to mixed schools. However, we also identify a sweet spot in the parameter space in which a larger proportion of tolerant parents makes the biggest difference. This is the case when parents have moderate preferences for nearby schools and there is only little residential segregation. Further experimentation unraveled the underlying mechanisms.",1-Apr,2021,24,2,10.18564/jasss.4544,http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4544
"Sopha, Bertha Maya; Sakti, Sekar; Prasetia, Ari Carisza Graha; Dwiansarinopa, Marselina Winda; Cullinane, Kevin",Simulating long-term performance of regional distribution centers in archipelagic logistics systems,MARITIME ECONOMICS & LOGISTICS,"Indonesia has reevaluated its archipelagic logistics system to implement a strategic shift from a point-to-point network to a hub-and-spoke network, with a plan to establish seven new regional distribution centers (RDCs). To supplement the previous qualitative assessment of the plan and to potentially justify continuing with its implementation, this paper aims to evaluate the prospective long-term performance of the planned RDCs within a hub-and-spoke (HS) network. The chosen methodology for this analysis is a hybrid of optimization and simulation, using an agent-based modeling and simulation platform that incorporates a geographic information system (GIS) element to provide a realistic geographical context. This constitutes a relatively novel innovation in logistics research. Experiments were developed to estimate the logistics performance of the hub-and-spoke network and planned RDCs, as well as to identify potential problems such as bottlenecks at the RDCs and the relative (in)efficiency of the selected multimodal transport. Transport costs, inventory costs, and the order backlog of RDCs are evaluated based on the average results from 100 replications. Outcomes from the model are validated against empirical data on Indonesia's logistics costs from the World Bank. Model results indicate that the hub-and-spoke network performs better than the point-to-point network when it comes to transportation costs. Since this is found to be the dominant element of total logistics costs, appropriate modal choice and route optimization are, therefore, critical to reducing logistics costs. The planned RDCs are found to have significant imbalance in their loadings, which is likely to produce bottlenecks. The paper concludes that a planned move to a hub-and spoke system is appropriate and that the planned investment in the RDCs is therefore justified. However, there is a need to streamline the predicted loadings at the RDCs to avoid bottlenecks. Our results suggest that the government should reopen the case and reevaluate the locations and coverage of each RDC. More generically, it is concluded that the application of hybrid optimization and simulation using agent-based modeling and simulation is feasible and the methodological approach adopted herein is generalizable to other archipelagic logistics systems.",DEC,2021,23,4,10.1057/s41278-020-00166-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41278-020-00166-3

CASE STUDY: TONKABON, IRAN",ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,"Deforestation and changes in forest cover are subject to the effects of many factors: economic, social, cultural, political, and environmental and their interactions. To assess these factors, one should necessarily know their nature and then model them. Nowadays many models have been introduced to explore deforestation, however most of them are based on past events and do not pay enough attention to socioeconomic factors. Moreover, considering the future is sometimes absent in those models. The present study develops an agent-based model for studying deforestation and changes in forest land cover using a case study. The model assesses deforestation in the past and then concentrates on the future of forest land cover. The study area is located in the north of Iran. The socioeconomic factors considered in this research as agents are farmers, ranchers and lumberjacks. The information and statistics of the agents were gathered over 10 years and so their manner in the forest was simulated. To validate the model, satellite imagery was used. The comparison between the simulated forest and the real one shows the power of the model as being 76% correct considering the Kappa coefficient. The results of forecasting reveal that the forest land cover will be reduced by 189 ha in 10 years' time.

Based on the parameters of frequency and intensity of influence of group leaders on the population, the proposed model is constituted by two layers: 1) a physical layer of the population that is influenced by and 2) a virtual layer of group leaders. The model of negotiation and survival of group leaders are governed by the nature-inspired evolutionary process of queen ants, also known as Foundress Dilemma. The motivation of using a virtual grouping concept (instead of taking a subset of population as the group leaders) is to stay focused on finding the conditions leading individuals in a society tolerating a significantly diversified (desegregated) neighborhood, rather than, indulging into complex details, which would be more relevant to studies targeting the evolution of societal group and leaders. A geographic information system-driven simulation is performed, which reveals that: 1) desegregation is directly proportional to the frequency of group leaders' contact with the population and 2) mostly, it remains ineffective with an increase in the intensity of group leaders' contact with the population. The mechanism of group selection (the conflict resolution model resolving the Foundress Dilemma) reveals an exciting result concerning negative influence of cooperative group leaders. Most of the time, desegregation decreases with increase in cooperative leaders (the leaders enforcing desegregation) when compared with fierce leaders (the leaders enforcing segregation).",JUN,2018,5,2,10.1109/TCSS.2018.2818324,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCSS.2018.2818324

The difficulties in monitoring rodent population patterns have hindered the effective application of preventive measures of ZCL. This study presents a spatially explicit agent-based simulation model of R. opimus behaviors that is integrated with Geographic Automata System (GAS) and a heuristic optimization method, cuckoo search (CS). The model is used to explore the relationships among rodent population dynamics, ZCL incidence and authority interventions using statistical data generated from simulated rodent societies rather than observational data, which are difficult to obtain through field surveys. The model simulation considers three agent types: rodents, colonies and cell agents. The model components and overall approach are calibrated, investigated with sensitivity analysis and validated with empirical field data in a ZCL-endemic area in Isfahan, central Iran.

In North America, foraging studies largely focused on the population level with an emphasis on foraging energetics aimed at improving waterfowl production through increased carrying capacity of wetlands in breeding areas, an approach later expanded to nonbreeding grounds. In Europe, studies have instead focused on inter-individual differences in behavior of foraging ducks, with an emphasis on individual efficiency (e.g., methods, intake rate, patch choice) within the framework of optimal foraging theory. We suggest that agent-based models (also termed individual-based behavior models), which aim to predict habitat use from the heterogeneous behavior of different individual agents, can help to unify these approaches and would benefit considerably from increased collaboration and integration of the approaches of both North American and European researchers.

Interventions at the micro scale have the ability to affect the entire system, forcing an examination at the whole of systems level. Modelling plays an important role in determining the outcomes of policy intervention combinations, particularly when systems are identified as being complex. This study begins with a systems map tracing the nutrient cycling process between natural ecosystem processes and farm practices from the bottom-up within a top-down framework. Soil is at the centre of this approach, expanding links to other influences within the framework in order to understand the relationships between elements in an environmental-agricultural system. Moving to a generic model from a broad conceptual system map is problematic when crop types, plant mineral absorption rates, soil and geographic differences are to be accommodated.

Environmental contamination with Toxocara spp. eggs is assumed to be the best indicator of human exposure, but increased risk of exposure has also been associated with many other factors.

The objective of this work was to assess the validity of our current conceptual understanding of the key processes driving human exposure to Toxocara. We constructed an agent-based model predicting Toxocara antibody positivity (as a measure of exposure) in children. Exposure was assumed to depend on the joint probability of 3 parameters: (1) environmental contamination with Toxocara spp. eggs, (2) larvation of these eggs and (3) the age-related contact with these eggs. This joint probability was linked to processes of acquired humoral immunity, influencing the rate of antibody seroreversion. The results of the simulation were validated against published data from 5 different geographical settings.

We propose an agent-based market model that considers a spectrum of different information-sharing mechanisms: no information sharing, information sharing among friends and pheromone-like information sharing. Finally, we build a unified model that accommodates all three of these information-sharing mechanisms based on the number of friends who can share information. We find that the no information-sharing model does not yield large economic zones, and more information sharing can give rise to a power-law distribution of market size that corresponds to the stylized fact of city size and firm size distributions.

Therefore, there is a need for a rational assessment of the risk of evacuees from the affected area at different times. In this paper, a modeling framework is developed to assess and control the risk of the emergency evacuation process under toxic gas release. Data from geographic information systems, big data on the spatial aggregation of population activities, and multi-agent-based modeling are combined to formulate and simulate evacuation event scenarios under toxic gas release. The characteristics of evacuation message dissemination at different times were explored, while the risk of people evacuating at different times was assessed in terms of two dimensions: health and fear emotion. In this case study, the proposed modeling framework was used to assess the potential risks faced by people when following the original evacuation plan in the event of an accidental release of toxic gas. The results of the assessment show that the factors affecting the risk of the evacuation process include the geometric parameters of the sub-evacuation area (SEA; location of the SEA, delineation pattern of SEA, degree of crowding, complexity of the SEA environment, population density, and age structure of the population) and the rate of information communication. Therefore, a control strategy is proposed based on geometric optimization and emergency communication optimization.

"Yin, Fuzhen; Crooks, Andrew; Yin, Li",How information propagation in hybrid spaces affects decision-making: using ABM to simulate Covid-19 vaccine uptake,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE,"The notion of physical space has long been central in geographical theories. However, the widespread adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has freed human dynamics from purely physical to also relational and cyber spaces. While researchers increasingly recognize such shifts, rarely have studies examined how the information propagates in these hybrid spaces (ie physical, relational, and cyber). By exploring the vaccine opinion dynamics through agent-based modeling, this study is the first that combines all hybrid spaces and explores their distinct impacts on human dynamics from an individual's perspective. Our model captures the temporal dynamics of vaccination progress with small errors (MAE = 2.45). Our results suggest that all hybrid spaces are indispensable in vaccination decision-making. However, in our model, most of the agents tend to give more emphasis to the information that is spread in the physical instead of other hybrid spaces. Our study not only sheds light on human dynamics research but also offers a new lens to identifying vaccinated individuals which has long been challenging in disease-spread models. Furthermore, our study also provides responses for practitioners to develop vaccination outreach policies and plan for future outbreaks. Our model suggests that physical space weighs more than relational and cyber spaces in individuals' vaccination decision-making. This implies that health authorities should prioritize place-based vaccination outreach plans in addition to online campaigns.In our model, different age groups demonstrate various preferences for hybrid spaces to receive vaccine-related information. Therefore, policymakers could tailor their vaccine outreach policies to match the preferred information sources of different age groups.Our results suggest that while adults (ages 18-64) care more about physical space, teenagers (ages 12-17) give more attention to cyber space, and senior people (65+) prefer relational space.",2-Jun,2024,38,6,10.1080/13658816.2024.2333930,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2024.2333930
"Kang, Heesuk; Lee, Kyu-Min; Yang, Jae-Suk",The potential for cascading failures in the international trade network,PLOS ONE,"In our study, we introduce indicators that quantify the influence of each country in complex trade scenarios involving the exchange of raw materials, intermediate goods, and final products across multiple countries. We systematically employ an agent-based model to simulate the propagation of failures from one node to the entire network. This approach allows for the assessment of the impact of each country and the identification of patterns of interaction in the multi-step trade network. Unlike conventional analyses of trade networks, which depict straightforward single-step import/export transactions, our approach captures the intricate realities of processes like raw material procurement, production, and sales in numerous countries from a macroscopic perspective. The findings of our analysis of trade data spanning from 1990 to 2022 reveal several key insights. Firstly, sensitivity to changes in trade volume leading to global failures within interconnected networks has intensified over time. The potential of failure propagation across countries has increased over time, as has the interconnectedness of countries in the global trade landscape. Secondly, despite the increased sensitivity to changes in global trade volume, many countries have become less vulnerable to the influence of others within their multi-step trade networks. This trend aligns with deglobalization, which is evidenced by events such as Brexit and the surge in protectionist measures; these changes indicate a shift in the balance of influence within global trade networks. Thirdly, the results of our analysis of the relationship between load changes and global failures from a regional perspective reveal an intriguing phenomenon: despite limited direct trade connectivity, the interaction between the Latin American and Sub-Saharan African regions is considerable. This suggests the existence of hidden connections between intermediary countries, such that one region's actions can alter the load sensitivity of another, impacting them in unforeseen ways. Furthermore, intra-regional interactions are diminishing in East Asia, while Europe is experiencing a gradual increase in interactions.

However, there is still a lack of models that incorporate the processes of farm succession within farm households and how these lead to agricultural abandonment. This study aims to simulate the effects of socio-environmental policy mixes on the mitigation of agricultural abandonment in the heritage landscape of Ifugao rice terraces, Philippines by developing an empirically-grounded Agent-Based Model (ABM). This ABM utilizes spatially explicit data and a logistic model to model how socio-ecological processes such as changing environmental conditions, cultivation of land, and succession of farmlands emerge to spatial patterns of paddy fields. Model validation showed that simulated paddy field maps achieved a minimum Fuzzy Kappa statistic of 0.7780, thus the model was deemed suitable for prediction of future scenarios. Simulation of the impacts of policy mixes from 2020 to 2050 showed that the provision of aid in restoring eroded terraces is effective in mitigating agricultural abandonment, preventing almost half of the agricultural abandonment compared to the Business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. Meanwhile, promoting the heritage value of the terraces to the youth and provision of monthly subsidies to farm owners did not exhibit significant mitigation of agricultural abandonment, preventing only 3% of the total abandonment compared to the BAU scenario. The findings suggest that policies directly affecting the farmlands will have a quicker mitigating effect on abandonment than policies affecting the farm owners or children that may take time to manifest.",MAY,2024,80,,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102491,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102491

Most existing models for PBSSs based on top-down approaches have limitations in reflecting Eoulling users' behavioral characteristics and analyzing their convenience. Unlike these, the proposed model is based on a bottom-up approach of agent-based simulation. We model each user as an agent to capture their bicycle rental and return behaviors, and analyze user convenience through interactions with bicycle station agent models. To improve model fidelity, multiple parameters for determining agent behaviors are extracted from the actual operations data of Eoulling, along with the population and geographic information of Sejong City. The validation results showed that the proposed model accurately describes the behavioral characteristics.

This study aims to explore the dynamics of the LNG trade by using these new tentative routes with conventional sea lanes and estimating the changes in the LNG trade. We utilize Agent-Based Modeling to develop a global LNG model with interactive GIS features, where the agents are the players in the LNG market. The results demonstrate the preponderance of the North-East Passage (NEP, Eurasian Arctic waters) over the North-Western Passage (NWP, the Canadian Arctic) in providing a shortcut connecting Europe with Asia. This passage favors a growing exporter like Russia with exporting facilities in Siberia and future strategic projects to increase liquefaction capacity. The NEP becomes crucial when considering scenarios of a European ban on Russian imports, as European countries are planning due to the crisis with Russia. On the importing side, the Asian Pacific and South Asian importers are the winners with a diverse and shorter LNG supply source. Future Canadian projects may also benefit from these new highways. However, there are also substantial challenges to providing the NEP with the proper infrastructure and systems to make the Polar LNG journeys safe and sound shortly.

The vehicle composition and the timing of the traffic light signal scheduling play an important role in controlling the traffic flow and facilitate road users, particularly in densely populated urban cities. Since road capacity in urban cities changes throughout the day, an optimal traffic light signal duration might be different. Hence, in this paper, the effect of vehicle composition and traffic light phases on traffic flow during peak and off-peak hours in Georgetown, Penang, one of the highly populated cities in Malaysia, is investigated. Through Agent-Based Modelling (ABM), this complex system is simulated by integrating the driver's behaviour into the model using the GIS and Agent-Based Modelling Architecture (GAMA) simulation platform. The result of predicted traffic flow varies significantly depending on the vehicle composition while the duration of the traffic signal timing has little impact on traffic flow during peak hours. However, during off-peak hour, it is suggested that 20 s duration of green light provides the highest flow compared to 30 s and 40 s duration of green light. This concludes that the planning for traffic light phasing should consider multiple factors since the vehicle composition and traffic light timing for an effective traffic flow varies according to the volume of road users.",JUN,2023,12,6,10.3390/ijgi12060226,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi12060226

Agent-based model (ABM) based on the modeling idea of bottom-up can offer the ability to simulate the complex individual behaviors that generate spatial population distribution. Previous ABMs were unable to be extended for simulation of spatial population distribution at a fine scale due to the shortage of fine characterization of the urban environment and the calibration of agents' behavior. This study filled these gaps by proposing a genetic algorithm-ABM (GA-ABM) for fine-scale simulation of spatial population distribution in a manufacturing metropolis. In this model, the employment and residential choice behaviors of agents were defined by the labor economic theory and discrete selection model. Multisource geospatial big data such as enterprise points-of-interest big data and building footprints data were used to finely characterize the labor market and urban environment to reflect the impact of agents' employment choices on their residential decision. Furthermore, the grid-scale population investigation big data were combined with the GA to calibrate the agents' residential decision behaviors. The proposed model was used in Dongguan, the typical manufacturing metropolis in China. As a comparison, the expert-experience-based method-ABM (EEBM-ABM) was also conducted by using the same data set. Through the comparison of the results produced by these two models, it was demonstrated that the model coefficient calibrated by GA could effectively reflect the agents' residential decisions. The calibrated GA-ABM is more capable than EEBM-ABM in simulating spatial population distribution in a manufacturing metropolis. Hence, the proposed model can be used to simulate spatial population distribution in a manufacturing metropolis which helps the urban planner to conduct scientific urban planning.",JUN,2023,27,4,10.1111/tgis.13068,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tgis.13068

Leonardo",City-scale model for COVID-19 epidemiology with mobility and social activities represented by a set of hidden Markov models,COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,"Background and objective: SARS-CoV-2 emerged by the end of 2019 and became a global pandemic due to its rapid spread. Various outbreaks of the disease in different parts of the world have been studied, and epidemiological analyses of these outbreaks have been useful for developing models with the aim of tracking and predicting the spread of epidemics. In this paper, an agent-based model that predicts the local daily evolution of the number of people hospitalized in intensive care due to COVID-19 is presented. Methods: An agent-based model has been developed, taking into consideration the most relevant characteristics of the geography and climate of a mid-size city, its population and pathology statistics, and its social customs and mobility, including the state of public transportation. In addition to these inputs, the different phases of isolation and social distancing are also taken into account. By means of a set of hidden Markov models, the system captures and reproduces virus transmission associated with the stochastic nature of people's mobility and activities in the city. The spread of the virus in the host is also simulated by following the stages of the disease and by considering the existence of comorbidities and the proportion of asymptomatic carriers. Results: As a case study, the model was applied to Paran ' a city (Entre Rios, Argentina) in the second half of 2020. The model adequately predicts the daily evolution of people hospitalized in intensive care due to COVID-19. This adequacy is reflected by the fact that the prediction of the model (including its dispersion), as with the data reported in the field, never exceeded 90% of the capacity of beds installed in the city. In addition, other epidemiological variables of interest, with discrimination by age range, were also adequately reproduced, such as the number of deaths, reported cases, and asymptomatic individuals. Conclusions: The model can be used to predict the most likely evolution of the number of cases and hospital bed occupancy in the short term. By adjusting the model to match the data on hospitalizations in intensive care units and deaths due to COVID-19, it is possible to analyze the impact of isolation and social distancing measures on the disease spread dynamics. In addition, it allows for simulating combinations of characteristics that would lead to a potential collapse in the health system due to lack of infrastructure as well as predicting the impact of social events or increases in people's mobility.",JUN,2023,160,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.106942,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.106942

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between shelter-seeking behaviour of ewes during the lambing period and the microclimate influenced by landscape shelter features. Artificial and natural shelter was provided to Aberfield ewes (n = 15) on an upland sheep farm in Wales, UK, which were then continuously monitored for 14 days using global positioning system tracking devices. Modelling of microclimate influenced by topographical shelter features at the test site was used to generate a 1 m resolution wind field for geospatial statistical analysis of localised wind speed. Ewes demonstrated an increased preference for natural (3.4-fold; p < 0.01) and artificial (3.0-fold; p < 0.05) shelter zones five times the height of the shelter, compared to the exposed area of the trial site. Wind-chill and modelled local-scale wind speeds were found to have the greatest influence on shelter-seeking behaviour, with temperature and field-scale wind speed significantly influencing livestock behaviour. Mean wind-chill temperature during the trial was 3.7 degrees C (min -5.3 degrees C; max 13.1 degrees C), which is within the cold stress temperature threshold (-3 and 8 degrees C) that requires thermoregulatory strategies such as shelter-seeking behaviour. An improved understanding of the relationship between microclimate and shelter-seeking behaviour in sheep, demonstrated through the agent-based model developed in this project, shall better inform the economic incentives (e.g., reduction in lamb mortality and forage requirements) behind silvopastoral practices that benefit farm productivity, livestock welfare and the environment.",DEC,2022,13,12,10.3390/f13122133,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13122133

Though previous studies have analyzed road blockages in specific cities, a more general approach valid for a wide range of road networks is required. In this study, different blockage rates were applied to three square lattice sizes as well as square, triangular, and hexagonal lattice configurations to simulate an assortment of road network geometries, and agent-based modeling was applied to quantitatively evaluate the resulting arrival probabilities and travel times. The results did not change significantly with the blockage rate, regardless of lattice size. For the square lattice, the route from the starting point to the destination point was secured when the blockage rate was <= 30%, but the probability of not arriving at the destination point increased considerably when the blockage rate was >30% and reached an infinitesimally small value when the blockage rate was >60%. When fewer routes connected the lattice intersections, the destination was more likely to be unreachable, even for a low blockage rate. These results were then validated by percolation theory, demonstrating an effective basis for travel feasibility evaluations when an urban road network is blocked.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Here we propose modifications to a model validation framework and illustrate this framework with a case study of territorial behavior. In species that defend territories, larger territories provide obvious benefits, such as increased access to food, shelter, and mates. An additional potential benefit is that larger territories could provide protection from intergroup conflict. Considerations from geometry indicate that per capita risk of death from intergroup violence should decrease with increasing territory size, insofar as conflict occurs mainly at the periphery. We tested this inference using computer simulations and data from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gray wolves (Canis lupus). We designed an agent-based model that allows territories to vary freely in size and shape. We present a framework for model validation and apply it to our agent-based model to substantiate its accuracy. Simulations from the validated model confirmed the predictions from geometry. Under a broad range of parameter values, per capita mortality rate decreased in larger territories. Similarly, using published data on rates of death from intercommunity aggression in 16 chimpanzee communities, as well as new data from 38 wolf packs, we found that per capita mortality rate correlated negatively with a measure of territory size. These findings indicate that in species with lethal intergroup aggression, one simple aspect of territory geometry - size - has strong effects on mortality. Several lines of evidence indicate that the per capita rates of mortality from warfare have decreased in many human societies over time. One factor contributing to this decrease may be the increasing geographic extent of political entities.",SEP,2022,471,,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2022.110063,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2022.110063

Results indicate that the efficacy of interventions does depend on local demographic factors and infrastructure, especially bus service. Additionally, demographic factors can act either to increase or impede food access. After distance to the store, the presence of a child under 5 in the household was the most significant limiting factor to accessing healthy food.

Generally, one MS may complete one MT, but mostly one MT needs more MSs to complete it cooperatively. Furthermore, these MSs are perhaps controlled and managed by different enterprises. As an autonomous entity, each MS generally makes decision in light of its own interests, and their own interests generally have conflicts with the others' and the collective ones. To solve the conflicts through MSs' cooperation is an efficient and low-cost method to maximize both individual and collective interests. Hence, the influences of individual decision-making behaviors on cooperation are explored and discussed in CMfg paradigm. The evolutionary game theory and agent-based modeling and simulating method are employed to model and simulate individual behaviors of MSs during the process of forming the coalition for completing MTs. In addition, the learning mechanism of MSs is discussed in the decision-making process. The simulation results show that decision behaviors of MSs are positively influenced by the information transparency of the CMfg environment and the learning mechanism of MSs effects on the cooperative emergence.",,2021,9,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3055587,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3055587

Method This study proposes a systematic approach to physician planning and allocating which are modeled with a framework starting from medical school intakes, residency training, and career retirement. Results The ABM can estimate physician levels for provincial government hospitals (OPS-MOPH) and other sectors. The model can demonstrate any geographical imbalance issues at the provincial level under the existing rural recruitment program implementation. Based on the ABM simulation result, although person per physician ratios reached the target of 1800:1 at the national level in 2019, Bangkok is the only province that reached the target. For other provinces, the ratio of OPS-MOPH is far from the target. It will need 10 more years to reach the target, and a geographical imbalance will still exist. A solution of modified rural recruitment program with the limitation of hometown jobs has been proposed to reduce the geographical imbalance.

Such an input data type widely exists in the studies of information propagation process, such as the rumor spreading through social media. In that case, a social network does exist as the media of the spreading process, but its link structure is completely unobservable; therefore, it is important to make inference of the structure (links) of the hidden network. Unlike the previous studies on this topic which only consider abstract networks, we believe that apart from the link structure, different social-economic features and different geographic locations of nodes can also play critical roles in shaping the spreading process, which has to be taken into account. To uncover the hidden link structure and its dependence on the external social-economic features of the node set, a multidimensional spatial social network model is constructed in this study with the spatial dimension large enough to account for all influential social-economic factors. Based on the spatial network, we propose a nonparametric mean-field equation to govern the rumor spreading process and apply the likelihood estimator to make inference of the unknown link structure from the observed rumor distribution flows. Our method turns out easily extendible to cover the class of block networks that are useful in most real applications. The method is tested through simulated data and demonstrated on a data set of rumor spreading on Twitter.",,2019,,,10.1155/2019/6902027,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/6902027

At the intrasocietal level, the model integrates scalar stress, social fission, sociocultural evolution, societal collapse, and Malthusian-Ricardian demographic dynamics. At the geographical level, the model includes warfare for territory and captives, territorial division due to social conflict, and territorial disintegration due to collapse. We found that a single variable slow, continuous progress in intensive agriculture - drives the social and geographical dynamics. Consistent with the archaeological and historical record, the model produced three consecutive eras: During the first era, simple societies dominate the region. They use extensive food production methods. Small complex societies of intensive agriculturists emerge intermittently in the core land, where intensification is feasible. Shortly after, they collapse or are annihilated by local simple societies. During the second era, some complex societies avert early collapse and annihilation. They expand by conquest. At all times, they coexist with simple societies. Some complex societies are destroyed in war; others collapse. From time to time, complex societies collapse en masse. During the third era, there are no more mass collapses. Complex societies slowly expand until they dominate the core land. Simple societies take refuge in the marginal land, where intensification is infeasible. Simple and complex societies coexist, separated by a moving frontier. In an ebb and flow, complex societies expand to the marginal land and withdraw to the core land. The results of the simulations are qualitatively consistent with prehistorical and historical case studies. The model replicates the progression from simple to more complex societies, and explains why that progression happened in fits and starts.",31-Oct,2018,21,4,10.18564/jasss.3799,http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.3799

The model naturally recapitulates that decreased transportation and information costs favor large companies. This suggests history dependence in the sense that new companies typically reemerge in the vicinity of old ones.

We investigate the case of urban neighbourhood activation for the support of the elderly during the more likely occurring extreme heat waves generated by climate change. The proposed integrative theoretical consideration makes on the one hand reference to social dilemma theory and on the other to concepts from behavioural theory and social psychology. The case context is particularly challenging because it involves intra-individual dynamics of psychological processes, inter individual dynamics of social influence and environmental dynamics governed by future climate scenarios. To account for the spatial and temporal dynamics of social mobilisation the proposed methodical approach is agent-based modelling. The presented social simulation experiments obtain their empirical grounding from a fine grained set of socio-geographic data for the target area which groups the population according to sociological lifestyles in a spatially explicit way. Simulation results show that social mobilisation of neighbourhood support can be substantially inhibited because passive habits establish quicker than prosocial behaviours which require successful social coordination prior to becoming habitual. In contrast, an alternative scenario simulation reveals that a time-limited intervention can provide an enlarged temporal window of opportunity for cooperative habits to stabilise and to persist after the end of the intervention.

The core of the model is given by the conflict detection and resolution module and by the directs module. Directs are flight shortcuts that are given by air controllers to speed up the passage of an aircraft within a certain airspace and therefore to facilitate airline operations. Conflicts between flight trajectories can occur for two main reasons: either the planning of the flight trajectory was not sufficiently detailed to rule out all potential conflicts or unforeseen events during the flight require modifications of the flight plan that can conflict with other flight trajectories. Our model performs a local conflict detection and resolution procedure. Once a flight trajectory has been made conflict-free, the model searches for possible improvements of the system efficiency by issuing directs. We give an example of model calibration based on real data. We then provide an illustration of the capability of our model in generating scenario simulations able to give insights about the air traffic management system. We show that the calibrated model is able to reproduce the existence of a geographical localization of air traffic controllers' operations.

To compare the speciation potential of two female mate-search tactics (best-of-n and threshold). Model: Generational agent- (or individual-) based simulation model with male and female individuals: polygynous mating system with explicit leks and two different female mate-search tactics: explicit modelling of food resource: explicit implementation of an ecological range variable (a(eco)) determining the range of food objects individuals of a given phenotype can eat (and thus the competition between individuals). Key variables: Individuals in one-trait experiments are characterized by a phenotype consisting of two traits. (eco) (defines preferred mates for females and preferred food objects for all individuals) and T (defines the degree of assortative mating of females). In two-trait experiments. females select mates according to T-mate (a mating trait independent of T-eco). Conclusions: Given a oue-trait system. a population call undergo competitive speciation to completion. New species occupy inches located anywhere in the environment and not Just in the extreme regions: species constellations are determined by (a(eco)). Given a spatially explicit ecological gradient model. populations do not speciate in geographical space: thus neighbouring, individuals constantly compete.

We constructed a comprehensive simulation model that integrates an agent-based model (ABM), geographic information systems, and a Bayesian networks (BN). This model meticulously simulates the decision-making processes of residents, influenced by policies, social dynamics, and environmental factors. A notable innovation in our study is the introduction of peer effects into the simulation model, a novel approach that reflects the interdependent and imitative nature of residents' adaptation processes. We also consider multiple scenario combinations to analyze behavioral patterns and collective emergence phenomena under different disaster shocks. The findings indicate that an increase in disaster occurrence probability prompts more residents to relocate to safer areas and heightens their disaster preparedness awareness. Moreover, our results show that different scenarios significantly affect residents' behavioral choices and sensibilities; interventions such as mandatory relocation and disaster subsidy policies can alter residents' adaptation strategies.

Results. Influenza cases were highest in counties with higher proportions of children. Cases were up to 30% higher in Black agents with both race-based and race-equal vaccination coverage. Compared with corresponding categories of White households, cases in Black households without children were lower and with children were higher. Conclusions. Racial disparities in influenza cases persisted after equalizing vaccination coverage. The proportion of children in the population contributed to the number of influenza cases regardless of race.

Agent-based modelling (ABM) is an alternative modelling approach that is gaining popularity in public health and epidemiology. As the field expands, it is important to understand how ABMs have been applied. In this context, we completed a scoping review of research that has been done on the ABM of BBVs.MethodThe inclusion/exclusion criteria were drafted using the idea of Population, Concept, and Context (PCC). The Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis, an extension to scoping review (PRISMA-ScR), was employed in retrieving ABM literature that studied BBVs. Three databases (Scopus, Pubmed, and Embase) were systematically searched for article retrieval. 200 articles were retrieved from all the databases, with 10 duplicates. After removing the duplicates, 190 papers were screened for inclusion. After analysing the remaining articles, 70 were excluded during the abstract screening phase, and 32 were excluded during the full-text decision.

Results show that areas around the city centre are generally preferred, but high rent prices and housing availability may prevent most residents from relocating to these areas. Other preferred housing locations are distributed around major tram and train lines and where rent prices are generally lower.

Testing different scenarios of event venue layout and crowd behavior at the end of an event might be useful to plan the event and said resource allocation. Our main objective is to model the non-urgent egress of participants at the end of an event, with possible applications for event management. That is when some resources are released (police and paramedics) and others are requested (urban cleaning teams). Using the agent-based GAMA platform, we implemented a spatially explicit simulation model upon an extension of the Social Force Model that considers group behavior, and a novel implementation of the social retentionphenomenon, to simulate non-urgent egress from public space mass gathering events. Focus groups with architecture, geography, and urban ergonomics experts were conducted for face validation and improvement of the model. We present the outcome of a series of simulations of a scenario mimicking a real-life music event that took place in a square in downtown Lisbon, Portugal. Cell phone data captured during the event was used to calibrate the model. We analyzed model performance when the number of pedestrian agents increases, to assess the feasibility of using our approach in participatory discussions with stakeholders responsible for resources management. On average, the egress evolution obtained in the simulations fit well with the evolution of cell phone counts captured during the event. The behavior of groups of agents evidenced real-life phenomena, such as the persistence of group cohesion and repulsion interactions (both with architectural obstacles and other agents).

Staged evacuation has been studied as a method to reduce evacuation time. However, a method is needed to confirm the effectiveness of staged evacuation and to optimize the strategy. This study evaluates the performance of staged evacuation with more realistic factors which are implementable in a simulation platform. The evacuation simulation was conducted using PRISM (Platform for Radiological Emergency Integrated Simulation Model), developed by Kyung Hee University and utilizing an Agent-Based Model. A city was modeled using GIS data for road networks, buildings, and administrative districts. The population distribution was made non-uniform based on building layout data, and evacuation areas were divided based on administrative districts for demonstrating purpose. The simulation varied the order of evacuation groups and the evacuation start time interval, comparing evacuation times and average speeds to evaluate each strategy. The results reached a few insights: (1) Certain staged evacuation strategies are effective in reducing evacuation times within the PAZ.

(3) There is no significant relationship between evacuation time and evacuation speed. In other words, even if the evacuation times of strategies are similar, the evacuation speeds may differ.

This paper introduces a way to reduce the time it takes for emergency staff assembly to be handled during radioactive accidents, which is one of significant factors to manage early stage situations. Using a type of computer modeling called agent-based modeling (ABM) on the NetLogo software, we examine how emergency responses are carried out, focusing on how emergency staff assembly workers are sent out and how they work together in a simulated setting. By integrating traffic and path-finding models, along with real-world GIS (Geographic Information System) data, our methodology allows for more realistic evaluation of response times under various scenarios, including harsh weather conditions (e.g., Heavy snow) and infrastructural disruptions (e.g., Earthquake). The findings reveal significant variability in emergency staff assembly times, underscored by the impact of environmental factors.

We discuss various sources of heterogeneity that we encounter in the use of UVA-EpiHiper to support modeling and analysis of epidemic dynamics under various scenarios.

This study evaluates patient distribution policies in healthcare networks through a case study following a simulated earthquake scenario to enhance resilience during such events. By integrating geographic information systems (GIS) to model road impacts, agent-based modeling (ABM) for patient movements, and discrete event simulation (DES) for hospital queues, six distribution policies were evaluated. The analysis prioritized two metrics: patient waiting times and unmet treatment demands within four days post-disaster. Results revealed that policies emphasizing minimal hospital wait times demonstrated superior performance, reducing average waiting times by 71% and unmet demands compared to proximity-based approaches. Sensitivity analyses highlighted human behavior's influence, with increased personal vehicle usage adversely impacting resilience. Conversely, expanding hospital capacities substantially improved resilience indicators. The findings underscore the importance of informed policymaking focused on wait time reduction to enhance healthcare access resilience. Incorporating real-time hospital wait times into ambulance dispatch decisions emerged as a promising strategy.

"Hatzis, Joshua J.; Kim, Jooho; Klockow-McClain, Kim E.",An Agent-Based Modeling Approach to Protective Action Decision-Related Travel during Tornado Warnings,NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW,"Tornadoes represent a significant threat to life and property and tend to evoke protective action in most people. Studies have suggested that many people travel to the nearest storm shelter or flee the area, rather than sheltering-in-place as recommended by the National Weather Service (NWS). While shelter-in-place is the recommendation of the NWS, for tornado safety, few studies have quantified the risk reduction when compared to traveling to a storm shelter or fleeing the area. To address this knowledge gap, we developed an agent-based model, the tornado warning-induced shelter, travel, and evacuation response agent-based model (TWISTER ABM), to simulate protective action behaviors in the city of Norman, Oklahoma, under eight protective action scenarios including: (1) everyone who responds to the warning (responders) seeks refuge in the nearest sturdy building (seek refuge), seeks shelter in a FEMA-rated shelter (seek shelter), or flees the area, (2) all responders flee the area, (3), all responders seek refuge (shelter-in-place), (4) all responders seek shelter, (5) all agents flee the area, (6) all agents seek refuge, (7) all agents seek shelter, and (8) all agents do nothing. We found that, for an EF5 tornado hitting Norman at rush hour, the overall fatality rates by protective action type were 0.6% for those who took no action, 0.3% for those who sought refuge, 1.5% for those who sought shelter, and 1.1% for those fleeing the area. We also found that fatality rates were reduced by a factor of 6.6 for Scenario 6 (shelter-in-place) over Scenario 7 (travel to a FEMA-rated shelter). We believe that models such as TWISTER ABM can be used by the NWS and emergency managers in their attempts at communicating the effectiveness of shelter-in-place. Tornadoes are dangerous windstorms that can cause serious injury or death to people who do not take protective action. The NWS states that sheltering-in-place is the safest form of protective action, but no studies to date have shown how much it can reduce casualties. We developed an agent-based model to study how changes in protective action type can influence the fatality rate (fatalities per 1,000 residents) caused by a tornado in the city of Norman, Oklahoma. We found that, for an EF5 tornado hitting Norman at rush hour, the overall fatality rates, for all model runs, were lowest for agents who sheltered-in-place (0.3%) and highest for those who traveled to public shelters (1.53%). We also found that fatality rates were lowest when all agents sheltered-in-place (0.24%) and highest when every agent responding to the warning traveled to public shelters (1.54%), a 6.6 times reduction for shelter-in-place. We believe that models such as TWISTER ABM can be used by the NWS and emergency managers in their attempts at communicating the effectiveness of shelter-in-place.",1-Feb,2024,25,1,10.1061/NHREFO.NHENG-1783,http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/NHREFO.NHENG-1783

We use an activity-based population network model and school immunization records to identify underimmunized clusters of zip codes in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Although Virginia has high vaccine coverage for measles at the state level, finer-scale investigation at the zip code level finds three statistically significant underimmunized clusters. This research examines why some underimmunized geographical clusters are more critical in causing outbreaks and how their criticality changes with a possible drop in overall vaccination coverage. Results show that different clusters can cause vastly different outbreaks in a region, depending on their size, location, immunization rate and network characteristics. Among the three underimmunized clusters, we find one to be critical and the other two to be benign in terms of an outbreak risk. However, when the vaccine coverage among children drops by just 5% (or 0.8% overall in the population), one of the benign clusters becomes highly critical. This work also examines the demographic and network properties of these clusters to identify factors that are responsible for affecting the criticality of the clusters.

First, we identify the damage to production facilities in the disaster-hit regions more accurately by using establishment-level census and survey data and geographic information system (GIS) data on the damages caused by the GEJE and subsequent tsunami. Second, the use of establishment-level data enables us to capture supply chains between non-headquarter establishments in disaster-hit regions and establishments in other regions.

Finally, our model incorporates sectoral heterogeneity by employing sector-specific parameters. Our findings indicate that the extended method can significantly improve the accuracy of predicting the domestic production after the GEJE, particularly due to the first three improvements utilizing various data sources, not because of the use of more sector-specific parameters.

We used geospatial analysis to obtain information about past land changes and Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) to predict possible land changes in the future. From the simulation results, if the community of Dusun Tonggong implements plantation practices by combining shifting cultivation and palm oil, the share of secondary forest disappearing in this scenario is relatively large, but it is the scenario that best accommodates conservation and economic needs. However, the total loss of the secondary forest in Dusun Tonggong due to uncontrolled indirect deforestation will lead to a lack of land to grow plants that support people's daily needs.

Using an agent-based model (ABM), we simulated the transmission of VRE within and between 3 care units according to different IPC measures. Methods: The ABM was modelled on short-stay medical wards, represented by 2 conventional care units and 1 intensive care unit. The scenarios consisted of the simulation of various compliance rates of caregivers with regard to hand hygiene (HH) in different contexts of IPC measures: (1) standard precautions for all patients, (2) additional contact precautions for VRE-carrier patients, (3) geographical cohorting of carrier patients, and (4) creation of an isolation unit with dedicated staff. Results: With <50% HH compliance, the dissemination of VRE was not adequately controlled. With 80% compliance for all patients (ie, standard precautions scenario), there were no secondary VRE cases in 50% of the simulations, which represented the best scenario. A more realistic rate, 60% HH compliance for all patients, revealed interesting results. Implementing an isolation unit was effective only if the level of HH compliance was low.

"Hunter, Elizabeth; Kelleher, John D.",Using a hybrid agent-based and equation based model to test school closure policies during a measles outbreak,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,"BackgroundIn order to be prepared for an infectious disease outbreak it is important to know what interventions will or will not have an impact on reducing the outbreak. While some interventions might have a greater effect in mitigating an outbreak, others might only have a minor effect but all interventions will have a cost in implementation. Estimating the effectiveness of an intervention can be done using computational modelling. In particular, comparing the results of model runs with an intervention in place to control runs where no interventions were used can help to determine what interventions will have the greatest effect on an outbreak.MethodsTo test the effects of a school closure policy on the spread of an infectious disease (in this case measles) we run simulations closing schools based on either the proximity of the town to the initial outbreak or the centrality of the town within the network of towns in the simulation. To do this we use a hybrid model that combines an agent-based model with an equation-based model. In our analysis, we use three measures to compare the effects of different intervention strategies: the total number of model runs leading to an outbreak, the total number of infected agents, and the geographic spread of outbreaks.ResultsOur results show that closing down the schools in the town where an outbreak begins and the town with the highest in degree centrality provides the largest reduction in percent of runs leading to an outbreak as well as a reduction in the geographic spread of the outbreak compared to only closing down the town where the outbreak begins. Although closing down schools in the town with the closest proximity to the town where the outbreak begins also provides a reduction in the chance of an outbreak, we do not find the reduction to be as large as when the schools in the high in degree centrality town are closed.ConclusionsThus we believe that focusing on high in degree centrality towns during an outbreak is important in reducing the overall size of an outbreak.",12-Mar,2021,21,1,10.1186/s12889-021-10513-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10513-5

In this context Systems of Systems (SoS) may be a solution but the study of such systems is far from over. An SoS is a complex system characterized by the particular nature of its components: the latter, which are systems, tend to be managerially and operationally independent as well as geographically distributed. This specific characterization led to re-think research fields of classic systems engineering, such as definition, taxonomy, modeling, architecting, etc. SoS architecting focuses on the way independent components of an SoS can be dynamically structured and can autonomously and efficiently modify their interactions in order to fulfill the goal of the SoS and to cope with the high dynamics of the environment. This paper contributes to the multi-agent and SoS research fields by proposing a new generic SoS model called SApHESIA which considers the SoS main characteristics found in the literature and extends the notion of environment and interactions between component systems. It also proposes a new SoS architecting procedure based on the Adaptive Multi-Agent System (AMAS) approach that advocates full cooperation between all the components of the SoS through the concept of criticality. This criticality is a measure, local to each component, expressing its difficulties to reach its local goals. In this procedure, the SoS architecture evolves to self-adapt to the dynamics of the environment in which it is plunged, while considering the respective local goals of its components. An instantiation of SApHESIA to two distinct cases studies from different domains (logistics and exploratory missions) is done to obtain two SoSs. These two SoS are then coupled to form a new SoS at an upper level. Evaluations of these SoSs show that their cooperation make each of them more efficient. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Yet fundamental aspects of how this process can ultimately lead to cultural divergences between rural and urban segments of society are currently poorly understood. This article uses an agent-based model to isolate and analyze one very basic yet essential facet of this issue, namely, the question of how the intrinsic differences in urban and rural population densities influence the levels of cultural homogeneity/heterogeneity that emerge within each region. Because urban and rural cultures do not develop in isolation from one another, the dynamical interplay between the two is of particular import in their evolution. It is found that, in urban areas, the relatively high number of local neighbors with whom one can interact tends to promote cultural homogeneity in both urban and rural regions. Moreover, and rather surprisingly, the higher frequency of potential interactions with neighbors within urban regions promotes homogeneity in urban regions but tends to drive rural regions towards greater levels of heterogeneity.",31-Oct,2020,23,4,10.18564/jasss.4391,http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4391

Based on the innovative work of Thomas Schelling, ABMs are used to represent, analyze, and forecast emergent spatial-temporal dynamics of residential segregation. Segregation is modelled by representing the complex dynamics between individual agents with various socio-demographic profiles who self-organize into spatial clusters of alike individuals. Agents are typically classified into broad panethnic categories such as Asian or Hispanic, however these categories group together individuals from a very large number of countries that are ethnically and economically distinct and thus have diverse settlement patterns. Therefore, the objective of this study is to implement an ABM that simulates the spatio-temporal dynamics of segregation that emerge from interactions between incoming immigrants who are classified at two different levels of aggregation. At the aggregate level, ethnic groups are defined based on typical broad panethnic categories. At the disaggregate level, the Asian category is further disaggregated. The ABM is implemented to simulate processes leading to segregation in the City of Toronto and Metro Vancouver using actual geospatial and census data. The simulated spatial patterns of segregation are compared with actual census data that records the real settlement patterns of immigrants of various ethnicities. In addition, the degree of segregation is quantified and compared with the degree of segregation measured from the actual census data. Results show that both the spatial patterns of segregation and the measure of segregation are significantly influenced by the level of aggregation of the various ethnicities.

SSDs operate through service nodes (i.e., field offices, chapters, branches) in a network configuration. Therefore, the managerial decision of where to locate the field offices is an important one. An agent-based model to recreate agents' interactions as proxies of those exchanges occurring in real SSD settings is used. A series of validation experiments instill confidence that our model can be used as a virtual research laboratory. This paper contributes to the field of organizational design by testing a model able to recreate different policies that combined with different operating conditions impact the network over time and space. In addition, it provides experimental insights on what type of network configuration might provide a higher number of services delivered over time across the service network. The results can inform those defining the service system architecture looking to achieve SSD's goals considering the demographics of the markets served.

We find that varying the dynamics of agent interaction causes the emergence of differential degree distributions as well as nonlinear dynamics in social and spatial inequalities. The scale-free property of degree connectivity vanishes when tie formation dominates tie dissolution, with power laws re-emerging when tie dissolution is of equal strength or stronger than tie formation. Furthermore, we find a nonlinear relationship between network density and agent inequality in social resources. In particular, multiple phase transitions occur where the relationship is positive in one phase but negative in another. This suggests that, contrary to intuition, higher connectivity can have an adverse distributional impact by benefiting the already privileged. Critically, we find a tradeoff between agent inequality and spatial inequality where the geographic concentration of social resources accompanies a more equal distribution of connectivity. Finally, the disadvantage of agents with limited spatial reach is exacerbated as network density increases. Our results thus highlight the importance of distinguishing between social and spatial inequality in policymaking.",NOV,2016,57,2月3日,10.1007/s00168-016-0791-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00168-016-0791-4

W.; Wiedmann, M.",Toward agent-based models for pre-harvest food safety,IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,"The safety of fresh produce is a concern because many types of produce are consumed raw, and the incidence of produce-borne diseases appears to be increasing. Good agricultural practices (GAPs) can limit the chances for contamination of produce, but farms are open systems where interactions with surrounding lands can override benefits from GAPs. The extent to which interactions between farms and the surrounding landscape contribute to sporadic disease is not yet clear, but outbreaks have arisen from contamination of produce by wildlife, manure, or irrigation water. We hypothesize that the ability to control transmission of pathogens to produce, before harvest, partially depends on understanding the dynamics of pathogen populations, with some landscapes exhibiting combinations of characteristics that increase pathogen dispersal to croplands. The landscape processes leading to contamination are difficult to predict with current techniques. In this perspectives paper, we advance a foundation for modeling food contamination processes in agricultural landscapes using a combination of remote-sensing technologies and ecological modeling of pathogen dispersal, enabled by geographic information systems. With the development of predictive models, cultivation practices can be adapted to local conditions to reduce food contamination by controlling the connectivity between foodborne pathogen reservoirs and food production blocks on farms.",SEP-NOV,2016,60,5月6日,10.1147/JRD.2016.2596378,http://dx.doi.org/10.1147/JRD.2016.2596378

In particular, challenging multivalent management programs, such as Area Wide Integrated Pest Management (AW-IPM), face daunting problems of complexity at multiple spatial scales, ranging from landscape level processes to those of smaller scales such as the parasite loads of individual animals. Daunting temporal challenges also await resolution, such as matching management time frames to those found on ecological and even evolutionary temporal scales. How does one deal with representing processes with models that involve multiple spatial and temporal scales? Agent-based models (ABM), combined with geographic information systems (GIS), may allow for understanding, predicting and managing pest control efforts in livestock pests. This paper argues that by incorporating digital ecologies in our management efforts clearer and more informed decisions can be made.

This study develops an agent-based model to simulate social and economic influences on neighborhood choice. With Danville, Illinois, as an empirical context, a pattern-oriented approach is employed to examine the role of social ties in shaping intraurban household mobility. In the model, household agents decide whether and where to relocate within the community based on factors such as neighborhood attractiveness, affordability, and the density of a household's social network in the prospective block group. Social network and neighborhood choices are encoded with logit utility functions. The relative influence of factors affecting the formation of social ties in the simulated social network, such as geographic proximity, similarity of income, race, and presence of children, are adjusted using parameter variation to create alternative model settings. Simulated migration patterns resulting from different network and neighborhood choice coefficients are compared with observed migration patterns over a two-year period. Based on 1,000 simulation experiments, a regression of homeowner migration error (the difference between simulated and observed migration) relative to the parameter settings revealed components of social network choice such as income, race, and probability of local ties to be significant in matching observed migration patterns.

"Altaweel, Mark; Sallach, David; Macal, Charles",Mobilizing for Change: Simulating Political Movements in Armed Conflicts,SOCIAL SCIENCE COMPUTER REVIEW,"Theories on the establishment and propagation of political movements through mobilization have emerged and evolved over the last half century. Among the major theoretical frameworks that have been advanced are resource mobilization theory, political process theory, and culture theory. However, despite these developments, relatively few methodological approaches have applied bottom-up computational modeling and simulation in explaining movement development in conflicts. With developments made in computational methods, the integration of social theory with modeling and simulation is a natural progression in creating tools that allow analysts, policy makers, and researchers the means to assess the successes or failures of political movements during armed struggles. This article presents an agent-based model and simulation that applies several frequently used theoretical approaches to political mobilization and explores the extent to which group resources and identity shaped conflicts in Central Asia. Given their historical, cultural, political, economic, and geographical circumstances, the authors seek to determine why different movements experienced contrasting political mobilization outcomes. Results show that receiving outside resources could help a relatively weak group, with limited mobilization, overcome opposition that is initially better mobilized, while shared identity and sufficient risk taking are shown to be potentially strong factors in producing successful mobilization. More broadly, the approach advanced enables analysts and researchers to better anticipate future mobilization events and projected paths of conflict by developing and understanding cause and effect relationships within relevant theoretical frameworks.",APR,2013,31,2,10.1177/0894439312451106,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439312451106

Uncovering underlying uncertainties requires integrating a diverse range of models and actors, and examining different assumptions implemented throughout the modeling process. Agent-Based Models (ABMs), are recognized as powerful tools for addressing the complexities inherent in activity-based modeling. Although the advantages of ABMs in activity-based models have been demonstrated, there remains a need for further exploration in two key areas: the application of integrated geospatial models to define spatial actors in ABMs, and the utilization of pattern recognition approaches, including Global Moran's I and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA), to uncover the hidden mechanisms of activity-related commuting. This paper proposes an integrated Geospatial-ABM approach to address this gap. The Geospatial-ABM was validated locally using realworld data and Error percent procedure to ensure its robustness. The model validation resulted in an average percentage error of 8.8 %, showcasing its strong potential for generalization.

We use the Geographical, Environmental, and Behavioural (GEB) model, a coupled agent-based hydrological model, and expand it with the subjective expected utility theory (SEUT) to simulate farmer behavior and subsequent hydrological interactions. We apply GEB to analyze the adaptive responses of similar to 1.4 million heterogeneous farmers in India's Bhima basin over consecutive droughts and compare scenarios with and without adaptation. In adaptive scenarios, farmers can either do nothing, switch crops, or dig wells, based on each action's expected utility. Our analysis examines how these adaptations affect profits, yields, and groundwater levels, considering, e.g., farm size, risk aversion, and drought perception. Results indicate that farmers' adaptive responses can decrease drought vulnerability and impact after one drought (6 times the yield loss reduction) but increase them over consecutive periods due to switching to water-intensive crops and homogeneous cultivation (+15 % decline in income). Moreover, adaptive patterns, vulnerability, and impacts vary spatiotemporally and between individuals. Lastly, ecological and social shocks can coincide to plummet farmer incomes.

Land-use change can significantly alter wildlife movement patterns and behaviour which may increase the risk of zoonotic disease transmission, particularly diseases with wildlife maintenance hosts that intersect regularly with farmland such as bovine tuberculosis (bTB). 2. This study utilized an agent-based model (ABM) with high-resolution input data to simulate badger responses to clearfell forestry across 100 sites in Ireland. The model environment was constructed from multiple GIS datasets, including sett locations, habitat, farm boundaries, and forestry operations. Animal movement and behaviour in the model were parameterised using detailed analysis of GPS tracking data from over 200 collared badgers in the wild. 3. Our results show that badger density and herd type were the strongest predictors of alien encounters-instances where badgers move beyond their established territories and enter farms outside their usual home range. These encounters, if used as a proxy for bTB transmission risk, represent opportunities for badgers to interact with livestock, particularly cattle, increasing the likelihood of disease spread. Dairy herds, despite being fewer in number compared to beef and suckler enterprises, had a higher risk of alien encounters. Larger clearfell events significantly increased alien encounters, supporting the hypothesis that landscape disturbances elevate disease risk. 4. Contrary to expectations, badger dispersal distance did not significantly affect encounter rates. Instead, landscape heterogeneity, including clearfell size and farm density, played a more substantial role in modulating encounters. 5. Validation of the ABM using empirical bTB breakdown data confirmed a positive correlation between simulated badger encounter rates per study site and real world bTB outbreaks within those sites. 6. This research provides a novel spatial framework for predicting bTB risk in disturbed landscapes, offering a valuable tool for Ireland's efforts to mitigate wildlife-livestock disease transmission.

Despite the critical role that characteristics such as health attitudes and vaccination status play in disease outcomes, the initialization of agent populations with these variables is often oversimplified, overlooking statistical relationships between attitudes and other characteristics or lacking spatial heterogeneity. Leveraging population synthesis methods to create populations with realistic health attitudes and protective behaviors for spatial ABMs has yet to be fully explored. Therefore, this study introduces a novel application for generating synthetic populations with protective behaviors and associated attitudes using public health surveys instead of traditional individual-level survey datasets from the census. We test our approach using two different public health surveys to create two synthetic populations representing individuals aged 18 and over in Virginia, U.S., and their COVID-19 vaccine attitudes and uptake as of December 2021. Results show that integrating public health surveys into synthetic population generation processes preserves the statistical relationships between vaccine uptake and attitudes in different demographic groups while capturing spatial heterogeneity at fine scales. This approach can support disease simulations that aim to explore how real populations might respond to interventions and how these responses may lead to demographic or geographic health disparities.

We combine geospatial and climate data in an agent-based system dynamics model to simulate temporally and spatially scalable rangeland human- environment-animal-forage relationships. Modeling highly variable grazing system elements requires both adaptability and mathematical realism. Agent-based modeling makes it possible to test alternative approaches to real-world scenarios without taking risks associated with actual experimentation on working operations. Our agent-based model, Ecological Comanagement of Rangelands, or ECo-Range, allows managers to simulate cattle grazing scenarios by setting environmental conditions and management decisions that affect simulation outcomes. In this sense, ECo-Range is not just a product of scientific inquiry, but a tool to be used for collaborative discovery, as it illuminates relationships among environmental conditions, management decisions, and ecological and livestock outcomes for modeled landscapes. ECo-Range explores the complexities of grazing management, embracing rather than excluding variability and heterogeneity inherent in rangeland social-ecological systems. We first present ECo-Range, explaining the model's relevance to the fields of simulation modeling and rangeland management. We then present a case study on the Colorado Front Range as proof of concept to test the utility, validity, and applicability of ECo-Range as a learning tool to explore scenarios related to government-owned landscapes that necessitate comanagement approaches to cattle grazing.

We utilized an Agent-based model (AxS model) to generate artificial trajectories from the Origin-Destination (OD) survey aggregated dataset and calculate individual accessibility metrics. The findings reveal that, overall, men have greater accessibility to opportunities than women in Curitiba. The exception is in income class A (the highest), where women tend to travel shorter, more central routes and use cars more frequently, leading to higher accessibility. However, women in other income groups (lower income) face lower accessibility than their male counterparts, largely due to living in peripheral areas with fewer local opportunities and being more dependent on slower transport modes such as public transportation and walking to access these opportunities. The gender accessibility gap widens notably as income decreases, showing the significance of intersectionality of income and gender factors. Counterfactual simulations revealed that the choice of transport modes has a greater impact on women's individual accessibility than the distances traveled. The discussion emphasizes the need for mixed land use in peripheral areas and improvements on public transportation to ensure extensive coverage and reduce travel times to mitigate the effects of gender and income inequalities.

Methods: This analysis focuses on two areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Beni and Butembo/Katwa, which were affected during the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak. To simulate Ebola virus transmission, we used a spatially explicit agent-based model with households, health care facilities, and Ebola treatment units. Model parameters were calibrated using data collected under the ring-vaccination expanded-access protocol implemented during the outbreak. The model was used to estimate the impact of the deployed ring vaccination strategy, compared to what would have happened if there had been no ring vaccination. The impact of alternative vaccination strategies (mass vaccination, targeted geographic vaccination, and ring-plus) was evaluated as well. Results: Compared to a hypothetical scenario where vaccination was not implemented, ring vaccination was estimated to have averted 54.3% (SD, 32.5%) and 62.7% (SD, 23.2%) of potential cases in Beni and Butembo/Katwa, respectively. Under ring vaccination, the average number of averted cases per 10 0 0 vaccine doses administered was 15.1 (SD, 16.8) and 27.8 (SD, 22.9), in Beni and Butembo/Katwa, respectively. In terms of number of averted cases per vaccine dose, ring vaccination was estimated to be more efficient than any of the other evaluated vaccination strategies. Conclusion: Despite some level of social instability, ring vaccination with the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was highly effective during the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. As compared to alternative vaccination strategies, ring vaccination was estimated to be the most efficient. (c) 2025 The Authors.

Combined modelling of COVID-19 disease cases and the concentration of its causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, in wastewater will necessarily deepen our understanding. However, this requires addressing the technical differences between disease, population mobility and wastewater models. To that end, we developed an integrated Agent-Based Model (ABM) that facilitates analysis in space and time at various temporal resolutions, including disease spread, population mobility and wastewater production, while also being sufficiently generic for different types of infectious diseases or pathogens. The integrated model replicates the epidemic curve for COVID-19 and can estimate the daily infections at the household level, enabling the monitoring of the spatial patterns of infection intensity. Additionally, the model allows monitoring the estimated production of infected wastewater over time and spatially across the sewage and treatment plant.

In the last few years, the dynamics of the pandemic have evolved, and so too have the challenges university campuses face in ensuring their communities' health and safety. This study introduces a complex and adaptable hybrid model, which was developed, applied, and validated using data from the peak incidents of SARS-CoV-2 during 2020-2021. It combines an agent-based model (ABM) with a modified SEIR system dynamics approach. Recognizing the shifting landscape of the pandemic, this model has been designed to function as both a historical case study of COVID-19 dynamics on a university campus and a framework for addressing future pandemic threats. By simulating disease propagation considering contact distance (i.e., 0-3 feet, 3-6 feet), contact duration (e.g., indoor layout, capacity, ventilation), and individual behaviors (e.g., partying, gathering, sporting, off-campus activities), the model serves as a comprehensive analysis tool. It incorporates GIS-based campus data, real-time Wi-Fi occupancy data, student schedule-based behavioral patterns to closely emulate campus life. The testing frequency (e.g., mandatory, voluntary), methods (e.g., PCR, antigen, antibody, saline gargle, saliva), and different containment policies (e.g., mask-wearing, vaccination) enhance the model's predictive capabilities. The model's flexible structure allows stakeholders to adapt it to current and emerging scenarios. Retrospective analyses indicate that strategies like indoor mask mandates, frequent testing, and high vaccination rates were pivotal in managing spread of disease.

This paper presents a process for integrating stakeholders into urban growth simulation, thereby enhancing sustainable decision-making. Currently, most urban growth models fail to incorporate the perspectives of diverse stakeholders, leading to reduced equitable participation in the decision-making process. To achieve long-term sustainability, it is imperative to include the input and viewpoints of stakeholders. This study follows a four-step approach: identifying relevant stakeholders, developing the framework, evaluating its effectiveness, and documenting lessons learned. The framework involves key steps, including initial participatory modeling, analysis of development pressures and suitability with stakeholders, and technical urban growth modeling. A unique combination of modeling tools and an innovative approach was employed, incorporating the default FUTURES (GRASS-GIS) model alongside the CA-Markov Chain, Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) (NetLogo), the Cellular-Automata-based Python model, and MOLUSCE-QGIS. This integrated approach facilitates the inclusion of stakeholder-based knowledge into conventional urban growth modeling, providing novel local lessons in science, technology, and innovation initiatives.

When dealing with point data on a map, these characteristics can lead to point clutter, reducing the readability of the map product and misleading users to false interpretations of patterns in the data, e.g., regarding specific clusters or extreme values. With this work, we provide a framework that is able to generalize point data, preserving spatial clusters and extreme values simultaneously. The framework consists of an agent-based generalization model using predefined constraints and measures. We present the architecture of the model and compare the results with methods focusing on extreme value preservation as well as clutter reduction.

EV evacuation can exert significant dynamic pressure on the TPNs during emergencies. This article presents a baseline reproducible two-stage emergency response framework. In the first stage, we develop a platform for the comprehensive simulation called EV evacuation integrated simulation model (EVEISM), utilizing agent-based modeling. The interaction between the agent models and the GIS-based environment models captures the behavior of EVs in the complete evacuation period, including pre-evacuation and post-evacuation charging, receiving notifications, making destination decisions, planning routes to avoid risks, and traffic dynamics. In the second stage, leveraging EVEISM results to enhance situational awareness, strategic pre-positioning of mobile energy storage systems (MESS) and optimal routing are conducted. A mixed-integer second-order cone programming model is established for the coordinated response of multiple power sources to dispatch MESS dynamically.

There is an increasing need to identify ways to efficiently target control efforts from local to regional scales.ObjectivesOur goal was to test whether prioritizing managed habitat using different treatments based on spatial measures of connectivity, including graph-theoretic measures, can improve management of invasive species and whether the level of control effort affects treatment performance. We also explored how uncertainty in biological variables, such as dispersal ability, affects measures performance.MethodsWe used a spatially-explicit, individual-based model (sIBM) based on the American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus), a globally pervasive invasive species. Simulations were informed by geographic data from part of the American bullfrog's non-native range in southeastern Arizona, USA where they are known to pose a threat to native species.ResultsWe found that total bullfrog populations and occupancy declined in response to all treatments regardless of effort level or patch prioritization methods. The most effective spatial prioritization was effort-dependent and varied depending on spatial context, but frequently a buffer strategy was most effective. Treatments were also sensitive to dispersal ability. Performance of treatments prioritizing habitat patches using betweenness centrality improved with increasing dispersal ability, while performance of eigenvalue centrality improved as dispersal ability decreased.ConclusionsWith the careful application of connectivity measures to prioritize control efforts, similar reductions in invasive species population size and occupancy could be achieved with less than half the effort of sub-optimal connectivity measures at higher effort rates.

Health economic models of public health interventions often do not incorporate the many determinants of individual and population behaviours that influence long term effectiveness. The aim of this paper is to draw on psychology, sociology, behavioural economics, complexity science and health economics to: (a) develop a toolbox of methods for incorporating the influences on behaviour into public health economic models (PHEM-B); and (b) set out a research agenda for health economic modellers and behavioural/ social scientists to further advance methods to better inform public health policy decisions.MethodsA core multidisciplinary group developed a preliminary toolbox from a published review of the literature and tested this conceptually using a case study of a diabetes prevention simulation. The core group was augmented by a much wider group that covered a broader range of multidisciplinary expertise. We used a consensus method to gain agreement of the PHEM-B toolbox. This included a one-day workshop and subsequent reviews of the toolbox.ResultsThe PHEM-B toolbox sets out 12 methods which can be used in different combinations to incorporate influences on behaviours into public health economic models: collaborations between modellers and behavioural scientists, literature reviewing, application of the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology, systems mapping, agent-based modelling, differential equation modelling, social network analysis, geographical information systems, discrete event simulation, theory-informed statistical and econometric analyses, expert elicitation, and qualitative research/process tracing. For each method, we provide a description with key references, an expert consensus on the circumstances when they could be used, and the resources required.ConclusionsThis is the first attempt to rigorously and coherently propose methods to incorporate the influences on behaviour into health economic models of public health interventions. It may not always be feasible or necessary to model the influences on behaviour explicitly, but it is essential to develop an understanding of the key influences. Changing behaviour and maintaining that behaviour change could have different influences; thus, there could be benefits in modelling these separately. Future research is needed to develop, collaboratively with behavioural scientists, a suite of more robust health economic models of health-related behaviours, reported transparently, including coding, which would allow model reuse and adaptation.",12-Oct,2024,24,1,10.1186/s12889-024-20225-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-024-20225-1

In order to explore the possibility of using microscopic pedestrian flow simulations for macroscopic speed modeling of pedestrian flows, a series of two-way pedestrian cross-flow simulation experiments were designed. Bidirectional pedestrian flows are defined as Peds1 and Peds2. The crossing angle and pedestrian flow rate are used as variables, and a bidirectional pedestrian flows simulation is designed as an orthogonal experiment. The crossing angles range from 15 to 165 degrees, and bidirectional pedestrian flow rate range from 1 ped/s to 8 ped/s. A series of simulations are built and performed on the GIS agent-based modeling architecture (GAMA) platform. By analyzing the flow data of bidirectional flows in the crossing area, it is found that when the Peds1 density falls below a threshold, Peds1 speed is determined by pedestrians themselves and mainly remains in a free flow state; otherwise, the Peds1 speed decreases with density. The clear effects such as Peds2 density on the Peds1 speed cannot be determined. A piecewise function combined with a linear function and an exponential function is constructed as the Peds1 speed model considering the influence of the crossing angle. The calibration results show that the piecewise function should be better than the non-piecewise function. Compared to the results of established studies, the results in this paper have some differences. Therefore, the simulation method cannot completely replace the scene experiments. However, this approach can provide suggestions for subsequent refinement of the experimental program, as well as a feasible direction for the construction of a speed relationship for bidirectional pedestrian flows.",7-Oct,2024,19,10,10.1371/journal.pone.0311538,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0311538

Lessons learned from the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi NPP accident underscored that for PRA, it is critical to model external control room (Ex-CR) human actions. The state-of-practice HRA methods, historically developed for the main control room HRA, are limited in capturing the unique nature of Ex-CR human actions, such as location dependence (in addition to the time dependence) of human actions and spatiotemporal interactions of human performance with the surrounding physical environments, for instance, hazard propagation.To advance the Ex-CR HRA in the context of the fire PRA for NPPs, the authors' team developed a simulation-based fire crew performance model using an agent-based modeling (ABM) technique. The ABM fire crew simulation was coupled with a fire progression model through a spatiotemporal interface using a geographic information system.

Challenges such as high population density, limited evacuation routes, and communication breakdowns complicate evacuation efforts. Vulnerable populations, urban infrastructure constraints, and the increasing frequency of disasters further contribute to the complexity. Despite these challenges, the importance of timely evacuations lies in safeguarding human safety, enabling rapid disaster response, preserving critical infrastructure, and reducing economic losses. Overcoming these hurdles necessitates comprehensive planning, investment in resilient infrastructure, effective communication strategies, and continuous community engagement to foster preparedness and enhance evacuation efficiency.

Using agent-based modeling, evacuation simulation scenarios are implemented using the Changhongfang community (Shanghai) while systematically exploring how diverse interpersonal relationships impact the efficiency of evacuation processes. The adopted methodology encompasses a series of group experiments designed to determine the optimal proportions of joint-rental occupants within the community. Furthermore, the research examines the impact of various exit selection strategies on evacuation efficiency.

We employ agent-based modelling and a formalisation of the conflict as an Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game. The study provides a nuanced understanding of conflict dynamics in a highly volatile region, focusing on microdynamics of an intense dyadic strategic interaction between two near-equally- powered actors. The choice of using a model based on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, though a classical approach, offers substantial insights due to its ability to model dyadic, equally-matched strategic interactions in conflict scenarios effectively. The investigation primarily reveals that shifts in territorial control are more critical than geographical or temporal factors in determining the conflict's course. Further, the study observes that the conflict is characterised by periods of predominantly one-sided violence. This pattern underscores that the distribution of attacks, and target choices are a more telling indicator of the conflict nature than specific behavioural patterns of the actors involved. Such a conclusion aligns with the strategic implications of the underlying model, which emphasises the outcome of interactions based on differing aggression levels. This research not only sheds light on the conflict in Rojava but also reaffirms the relevance of this type of game-theoretical approach in contemporary conflict analysis.",5-Jun,2024,19,6,10.1371/journal.pone.0297483,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0297483

To mitigate this risk, the Ballast Water Management Convention (BWMC) was adopted by the UN International Maritime Organisation (IMO), setting strict criteria for discharges of ballast water. However, the BWMC permits exemptions for shipping routes operating within a geographical area, known as a Same-Risk-Area (SRA). An SRA can be established in areas where a risk assessment (RA) can conclude that the spread of NIS via ballast water is low relative to the predicted natural dispersal. Despite the BWMC's requirement for RAs to be based on modelling of the natural dispersal of NIS, no standard procedures have been established. This paper presents a methodology utilizing biophysical modelling and marine connectivity analyses to conduct SRA RA and delineation. Focusing on the Kattegat and & Oslash;resund connecting the North Sea and Baltic Sea, we examine two SRA candidates spanning Danish and Swedish waters. We provide an example on how to conduct an RA including an RA summary, and addressing findings, challenges, and prospects.

However, for school choice, existing models have mostly been highly stylized, leaving open whether they are relevant for understanding school segregation in concrete empirical settings. To bridge this gap, this study develops an empirically calibrated agent-based model focusing on primary school choice in Amsterdam. Consistent with existing models, results show that substantial school segregation emerges when schools are chosen based on a trade-off between composition and distance, and also when households are relatively tolerant. Additionally, findings of (hypothetical) policy simulations suggest that it is important to understand which preferences for school composition and distance households have and how these interact. We find that the effects of policies aiming to reduce school segregation through geographical restricting mechanisms are highly dependent on those interacting preferences. Also, we assessed the contribution of residential segregation to school segregation. Our findings may have implications for methodologies aiming to estimate school choice preferences, such as discrete choice models, as these methodologies do not explicitly control for implications of these interactions and feedback mechanisms, which might lead to incorrect inference.",2-Jul,2024,48,3,10.1080/0022250X.2024.2340136,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.2024.2340136

Due to special geographical location and various process equipment, potential risks in ULSs, especially domino effect accidents, usually lead to catastrophic consequences and social impacts. In this study, a dynamic risk assessment model for analyzing domino effects in urban LNG stations (DRADL) based on agent modelling and simulation is proposed. Tanks and tank cars as well as vaporizers and boilers in ULSs are modeled. A set of physical process and effect models are employed as the simulation process in this paper. Considering the lightweight nature and narrow flammability limit of LNG vapor cloud, a cyclic process is applied to judge the consequences of vapor cloud dispersion, which could avoid overestimating the results. A real urban LNG station is taken as a case study for modeling its potential domino effect risk. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and the advantages of the proposed ABMS approach for LNG dynamic risk assessment.

"Blaydes, Lisa; Paik, Christopher",Old World Trade Diasporas,SOCIOLOGICAL SCIENCE,"What explains worldwide, historical patterns of trade diaspora dispersal? In the premodern period, trade diasporas were among the most important communities facilitating cross-cultural exchange over long distances. We argue that two general principles explain the proliferation of premodern trade diasporas. First, diaspora merchants were drawn to wealthy societies with the goal of obtaining access to high-value luxury goods produced through the development of complex supply chains. Second, traders sought to establish diaspora communities in locations that exhibited bioclimatic complementarities to the merchant's home region, thereby assisting the procurement of relatively uncommon natural resources. To empirically assess these arguments, we examine the historical record for information about the product composition of historical trade; collect data on the locations of trade diaspora communities across Eurasia between 600 and 1600 AD; and develop an agent-based model that specifies the agents' (i.e., traders') rule-based decisions to migrate in a wealth and resource-differentiated geographic space that represents Eurasia.

To enhance the credibility of model estimates, calibration against observed data is necessary. However, this process may lead to a paradoxical dependence of model parameters on location-specific data, thus limiting the model's geographic transferability.Methods In this study, we adopted a non-local model calibration approach to assess whether it can improve the spatial transferability of CystiAgent, our agent-based model of local-scale T. solium transmission. The calibration dataset for CystiAgent consisted of cross-sectional data on human taeniasis, pig cysticercosis and pig serology collected in eight villages in Northwest Peru. After calibration, the model was transferred to a second group of 21 destination villages in the same area without recalibrating its parameters. Model outputs were compared to pig serology data collected over a period of 2 years in the destination villages during a trial of T. solium control interventions, based on mass and spatially targeted human and pig treatments.Results Considering the uncertainties associated with empirical data, the model produced simulated pre-intervention pig seroprevalences that were successfully validated against data collected in 81% of destination villages. Furthermore, the model outputs were able to reproduce validated pig seroincidence values in 76% of destination villages when compared to the data obtained after the interventions. The results demonstrate that the CystiAgent model, when calibrated using a non-local approach, can be successfully transferred without requiring additional calibration.Conclusions This feature allows the model to simulate both baseline pre-intervention transmission conditions and the outcomes of control interventions across villages that form geographically homogeneous regions, providing a basis for developing large-scale models representing T. solium transmission at a regional level.",8-Nov,2023,16,1,10.1186/s13071-023-06003-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-023-06003-9

While many studies have paid attention to modelling influence and interaction, most of the literature assumes static agents, ignoring the frequent changes in physical locations expected in real life. This feature naturally allows humans to interact with diverse people and avoid disagreement, which heavily impacts the co-evolution of opinions, communities or isolation in human societies. Our previous work proposed an extension of the bounded confidence model inspired by the theories of homophily and cognitive dissonance, which concern humans' natural behaviours of attraction and disagreement. Although this demonstrated a marked difference to a static opinion model and purely random mobility, the limited experiments gave little insight into the causes or the resulting structures of consensus. This article addresses these shortcomings through a thorough investigation of the impact of mobility modelled by different mechanisms. Through extensive simulation, we observe a transition from multiple stable opinion clusters to complete consensus and a shift from a geographically based organisation to isolated structure-less agents. Lastly, we propose a novel classification of the different outcomes of self-organisation in opinion models, highlighting the patterns of emerging behaviours across the spectrum of interaction range and influence parameters.",APR,2024,32,2,10.1177/10597123231195423,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10597123231195423

To address this issue, we develop an agent-based computational model of epidemics with two features: 1) a population divided among multiple regions with heterogeneous vaccine coverage; 2) contact networks for individuals that allow for both intra-regional interactions and inter-regional interactions. The benchmark version of the model is specified using county-level flu vaccination claims rates from California. We isolate the effects of heterogeneity by holding overall vaccination levels constant, while changing the variance in the distribution of regional vaccine coverage. We find that an increase in spatial heterogeneity leads to larger epidemics on average. This effect is magnified when more inter-regional connections exist in the contact structure of the networks. The central result in the paper is that there is a non-monotonic relationship between the infection risk and the geographic resolution of vaccination rate measurement. Infection risk of an unvaccinated individual decreases in both the global rate of vaccinations and the rate of vaccination of the individual's specific contacts. Surprisingly, we find that the vaccination rate in an individual's home region does not have a significant impact on an individual's infection risk in our model. This has significant implications for an individual's vaccine choices. Global and local (network specific) vaccination rates are highly correlated with infection risk and thus should be prioritized as information sources for rational decision-making.

Travelers' behavior represents the mobility among cities from central cities to other cities and commuting behavior from the surrounding area of each city. ResultsLocal sensitivity analysis using one factor at a time was performed to test the SAMPAN model, and we have identified critical parameters for the model.

Applications in agent-based models allow for destination choice on an individual level including personal variables, like trip purpose, or situational variables. Commonly applied methodologies stem from econometrics, discrete choice theory and utility maximization using either revealed or stated preference data. This paper presents a framework to integrate cross-section flows between distinct geographic areas, which can be obtained from cordon surveys or mobile phone data. Proposed optimization methodology-based on extended shadow price theory-accommodates these complementary data sources as spatially distributed constraints, in addition to the destination capacity constraints such as workplaces. The new generic and robust optimization methodology accounts for constraints as observed on cross-section flows and destination capacities while maintaining econometric choice model theory. As a proof of concept, the suggested methodology is successfully applied in a real-case, agent-based application covering the tri-national Basel region with about 2 million residents, and a large set of 2 & BULL; 104 distinct destination alternatives. Due to different wage levels in all three coun-tries and other reasons, the region's cross-border commuter flows are highly asymmetric. Including data on cross-border flows obtained from a cordon survey, the choice model's mean deviation declines by 20% and more on a cross-section level and even more so on a choice alternative level, compared to calculations ignoring shadow prices. Moreover, mul-tiple scenario calculations show considerable improvements in planning and forecasting applications. The results demonstrate the suitability and relevance of the proposed approach to optimize destination choice mod-els with limited destination capacities in geographical regions usually characterized by travel demand asymmetries.",,2022,16,1,10.5198/jtlu.2023.2226,http://dx.doi.org/10.5198/jtlu.2023.2226

We introduce heterogeneity as a random distribution of defects or imperfections in a two-dimensional lattice. Two types of defects are considered separately: obstacles that represent geographic features, and opinion leaders, described as agents exerting unidirectional influence on other agents. In both cases, we characterize two collective phases on the space of parameters of the system, given by the density of defects and a quantity expressing the number of available states: one ordered phase, consisting of a large homogeneous group; and a disordered phase, where many small cultural groups coexist. In the case of leaders, the homogeneous state corresponds to their state. We find that a high enough density of obstacles contributes to cultural diversity in the system. On the other hand, we find a nontrivial effect when opinion leaders are distributed in the system: if their density is greater than some threshold value, leaders are no longer efficient in imposing their state to the population, but they actually promote multiculturality. In this situation, we uncover that leaders, as well as obstacles, serve as locations for the formation of boundaries and segregation between different cultural groups. Moreover, a lower density of leaders than obstacles is needed to induce multiculturality in the system. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
